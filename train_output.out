Topic 1 coronavirus spread: What were people saying about the spread of the novel coronavirus NCOV-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019?
[37, 38, 50, 2670, 5, 60, 20, 39, 59, 51]
0: It started.  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.
1:  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.
2:  Is past whatever the flu kills, you know hundreds of thousands each year. I think they're really important thing to understand about that is that those hundreds of thousands? I mean you have the flu does kill them however the flu as far as we know based on current evidence and whatnot is less contagious or at least I should say has a lower are not number meaning. It's it's not spread as easily.  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%
3:  Alice's of the situation as well as the I guess impact on the economy because of course that's where my mind often times goes. So quick recap. This is a novel virus.  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.
4:  Hon, but also some surrounding cities in the cash. I don't remember the name of the province hoobae. He hey some big cities right will haunt itself is roughly 11 million individuals. And this has spread to a ton of other countries around the world including Japan South Korea Thailand Australia. I think there's a potential reported case and France Russia the UK.  I believe and of course the United States we have soon to be three potentially three confirmed cases of this coronavirus here in the United States mostly from people that recently traveled to China usually the Wuhan providence province. And of course, this is a coming up on the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is is a big event for people traveling and whatnot. So certainly not a good time for this virus to be on the move.
5:  Based on his career trajectory. This is not just going to go away anytime soon. Right? I've learned a lot lately and I'm sure many other people have about this this are not of this coronavirus relative to past outbreaks and relative to other infectious diseases. They are not basically is this average number spread out over an entire population and it changes and it's different likely from population to population.  Stand on the point in time and their circumstances Etc.
6:  The room of the Chinese government how much have they downplayed this through manipulating these numbers? They taken a strong stance against that publicly but there's a thousand one reasons economically speaking socially speaking for them to say yeah. This is a not a big deal, right and also to to back that up with with numbers that are not out of this world. Now another thing that I found really interesting was was what they call the are not of this coronavirus are not is a measure of the  The spread of a pathogen essentially what it is is on average how many people will be infected by every person that is infected how many people will they spread it to? Right? So if it's one that means one person's present to one other person to another person right and that's just the overall the total number of infectors can stay steady below one is eventually it's going to die out on its own all else being equal and anything above 1 means that it's going to slowly be expanding and early on especially with these
7:  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.  And it's a relative of SARS the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was was a big deal back in the early 2000s. Also close relative of Words, which is similar to SARS. But Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome and very similar symptoms and whatnot. And the same is true for Coronavirus. Now that the mortality rate the deadliness of this new coronavirus. It's still up in the air. And again, we'll be talking more about those numbers a little bit later on today's episode.
8:  That's a big deal right and yet this has potential to do a lot more damage, but let's start off with a base case.  Based on his career trajectory. This is not just going to go away anytime soon. Right? I've learned a lot lately and I'm sure many other people have about this this are not of this coronavirus relative to past outbreaks and relative to other infectious diseases. They are not basically is this average number spread out over an entire population and it changes and it's different likely from population to population.
9:  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%  And furthermore we've known for a while that the flu even on some of its Worst Years. And of course, I'm excluding certain outbreaks of the flu. There's been like Hong Kong flu many decades ago. There was a Spanish flu or whatever. You want to call it French full American flew back in 1918, excluding those obviously the flu largely targets elderly populations young young populations and immune compromised which based on
 
Topic 2 greta thunberg cross atlantic: What were people saying about Greta Thunberg’s sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the fall of 2019 and its relationship to global climate change?
[285, 1054, 1079, 1053, 227, 1876, 226, 218, 221, 225]
0:  Way Beyond their scholarship and the cost of attendance but it's a tough tough issue and if sponsors won't pay big commercial dollars for women's soccer game on TV those women aren't likely to get paid a lot of money for playing soccer before your second trip you met what now is your husband and you got engaged to him in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean while he was back home. Did they engagement inspire you to get home quicker? Yes.  Yes, I asked him if you would marry me he had this romantic response. He said sure why not and from that point on I pretty much wrote around the clock till I get home December 3rd 1999. You completed your journey across the Atlantic at what point? Did you realize this trip was going to be a success? Yeah, probably December first when I saw Guadalupe for the first time in the middle of the ocean because at any point before that, you can always make a mistake that ends it or ends you
1:  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.  Because with warm water in the atmosphere is damper, that's all drawn up so that you not only get greater wind speeds. But lot more water is poured down on communities when it comes down and it would have been the past. I'm not sure where the original question was here. But I don't know either keep going. Well Greta to finger good. She's saying that that we need to panic about it because the situation is that bad and even if say we were wrong
2:  Ooh were fighting climate change is there it exists we have all of the tools in front of us. It's just a matter of acting like this. That's a great idea but like make it so that every new building that's built is NetZero. Like that would be amazing. Another thing that done. I don't know. It's a strange still giant, you know that and subdivision. I'll tell you why it isn't done and this relates to some of the questions you sent me. What what we can do is in relates back to Extinction rebellion, and Greta is  People have to speak up and not just to friends and family and stuff like that. They have to speak out and speak up and show up. Just imagine next Friday right have the second part of the global climate strike on this. Yes on the 27th of Millennium Park 12 to 3, but matching of thousands of people showed up for that rather than I mean probably a few hundred will come and hoping in the Thousand. Yeah, let's get a thousand but I'm saying imagine if that
3:  Those right? It's like a regular thing now well water levels are rising around the world because of climate change has occurred just till now and the the speed of it is also a very concerning because I think scientists were saying we wouldn't see a ice-free Arctic North Pole for another 20 or 30 years. I think it's if I have I may be wrong about that but not for 10 or 15 years at least and some  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.
4:  And then the sponsors had no, no, no, we're gonna sponsor a French woman to row the Mid-Atlantic route. We want you the American to row from the United States to France going west to east across the North Atlantic. I'm like, I'm crazy, but I'm not that crazy turned out I was so there I was alone on the North Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat and I lost Communications eight days from the start and it's really important. If you're going to try to row the North Atlantic to be able to track the Gulf Stream.  Men stay in the Gulf Stream, which is a warm water current that pushes his way toward France. It's one of the things that give southern France its temperate climate is the warm water current that you know sweeps that direction and if you can stay in the Gulf Stream the North Atlantic route can be very fast. When I lost Communications the boat got pushed north of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is very predictable close to the shore of the United States, but when it goes out toward the middle of the ocean, it's a little like a fire hose it can you can you know, go a hundred miles north
5:  So they were cutting class to go and stand in front of city hall or the capital and they're still doing it and that's what Greta started a year ago. And now she's up for a Nobel Peace Prize on mainstream news. It's hard to find Greta. Yeah, that's true more news. She's getting more news coverage than any environmental list on the planet, but it's hard to find her in mainstream news. Is that because it's it's seen as  I read an article I think was in the Atlantic about there was that climate report that came out and was maybe like six months to a year ago. That was just so sobering and it was this kind of art. It was the article was actually about that. It's so sobering that it's almost paralyzing and I think that yeah, I think that with the New Media thing the media wants to give you headlines that make you click right and it's going
6:  Hissing and all kinds of electrical problems and other issues with the boat so we had to turn back but because I was part of that I'd be came to the attention of some sponsors that wanted to sponsor the first woman to row alone across the ocean and I said, well, I'm crazy but I'm not that crazy and sure enough turned out I was and the original plan was I was going to take the Mid-Atlantic route going east to west what I have preferred to four years as the easy way.  And then the sponsors had no, no, no, we're gonna sponsor a French woman to row the Mid-Atlantic route. We want you the American to row from the United States to France going west to east across the North Atlantic. I'm like, I'm crazy, but I'm not that crazy turned out I was so there I was alone on the North Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat and I lost Communications eight days from the start and it's really important. If you're going to try to row the North Atlantic to be able to track the Gulf Stream.
7: Welcome to fighting for female a podcast about women of the sports industry and their Journey To Success. I'm your host Libby Gilliland.  Men had been allowed to leave the coast of the United States in rowboats Bound for Europe. They couldn't very well stop me just because I was a woman these are the wise words of Tori murden McClure 21 years ago. She became the first woman to row a boat across the Atlantic Ocean by herself rowing across the Atlantic wasn't a challenge enough Tori. Murden McClure didn't just throw her boat. She built her boat and this isn't the only record-breaking Expedition. She took she
8:  President declared. Thank you so much for being here today. You have accomplished so much over your lifetime from skiing across the South Pole rowing the Atlantic to a vast career and education and you are now the current president of Spalding University your education and your knowledge are immense but apart from your brain, your athletic ability stands out on December 3rd, 1999. You became the first woman in American to row across the Atlantic Ocean.  This topic is the focus of your book a pearl in the storm. So let's begin with talking about that Journey. When did you first become interested in rowing? And when did you decide you wanted to row across the Atlantic? So I am was a student at Smith college and there was a woman who had been there for at least 50 years who is like the Sorting Hat of Smith college and I was walking through the athletic complex. I was going to play basketball. I'm 6 feet tall. I'm you know knew I was going to play basketball at college and
9:  The Olympic team didn't make the team because I was too slow pretty basic problem, you know only a couple seconds to slow but at that level a couple seconds is an eternity and I heard about a rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean the Atlantic rowing race, and I was like, well, maybe a couple seconds to slow but I can go forever. And so I signed it to do it with a friend and that friend ultimately couldn't go and so I had a different person and then yet another person and we barely made it off shore. It was a little embarrassing.  Hissing and all kinds of electrical problems and other issues with the boat so we had to turn back but because I was part of that I'd be came to the attention of some sponsors that wanted to sponsor the first woman to row alone across the ocean and I said, well, I'm crazy but I'm not that crazy and sure enough turned out I was and the original plan was I was going to take the Mid-Atlantic route going east to west what I have preferred to four years as the easy way.
 
Topic 3 black hole image: In May 2019 astronomers released the first-ever picture of a black hole.  I would like to hear some conversations and educational discussion about the science of astronomy, black holes, and of the picture itself.
[213, 200, 196, 214, 195, 199, 977, 978, 212, 216]
0:  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.
1:  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.  home, I guess I thought then Interstellar Dome into
2:  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if  You fall into a black hole. But how do you even know how that even come along? Do you where does it go? Okay.
3:  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.  Here's how they proved that looks like scientists have actually proved that it's realistic fiction. Jake crazy, like accurate nuclear their time clocks meaning. It's just like a stopwatch but down to like a trillionth of a second and like they put one on the floor and they put one like on a hundred foot platform. And the closer you are to Earth. Obviously the gravity's heavier because like when she get higher gravity gets lighter,
4:  Wow, which brings up a crazy point that I thought about so you always hear about how the universe is like infinitely expanding. Yeah, you always hear that like you've written for me like like all the time Interstellar. It's the best space movie. It's not even just this best space movie. It's the best movie ever.  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if
5:  Zero impact to what we do each day. Like it doesn't matter weird. I think it's it is without question is horrible philosophically. Bullet philosophical Phyllis are yeah, I don't me wrong. It's an interesting Trend thought but the fact that it will never matter to us. Yes is the answer and if I just move my everyday routine people are getting I'm just saying like if  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.
6: What's up, my self-improvement people? It is Brian Ford with self-improvement daily. Take ownership of your personal development one tip at a time. I wanted to go back and highlight my favorite part of our last self-improvement sit down with Eric Kaufman brilliantly are accused the properties of celestial bodies to segment people into their leadership types in doing so we gained Clarity on the qualities of a conscious leader. Let's hear are Breakdown now, there's three types of celestial elements that I refer to it. Is that the moon the sun and a black hole the most ago like type of leader is a black hole, right? They suck all the energy into them the human being that has the need to just make it all about me and you've met people like that, right? They take the credit and the team they have the best ideas. They have the biggest office. It's all about me me me me me and a black hole is kind of a
7: Breakdown now, there's three types of celestial elements that I refer to it. Is that the moon the sun and a black hole the most ago like type of leader is a black hole, right? They suck all the energy into them the human being that has the need to just make it all about me and you've met people like that, right? They take the credit and the team they have the best ideas. They have the biggest office. It's all about me me me me me and a black hole is kind of a  Celestial body that just absorbs all the energy into it and projects no energy from it. There's another type of celestial body the Moon the Moon it doesn't have its own energy that emanates but it reflects light. So I will take some of the light but I'll reflect some of it back and then there's the conscious leader. That's the sun. The sun is a radiant ball of energy that does not get depleted because it shares its warmth and light and energy and that's the conscious leader, right? The conscious leader is an emanation of energy that is not
8:  No, everything is based in science up till the very end. Then he dives into a loophole theories. Yes, but it's only like it's a very small part of the movie up till that everything in the show is scientifically combatable meaning like okay, here's an example and one part they go to a planet and this planet is in the process of being sucked into a black hole, but it's far enough away where they can get onto it and get off. Now. The thing won't one thing they really dive into is the  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that
9:  The time is slower down here than it is up in a granny that's by like a you know, a millionth of a second but when you get closer to the black hole and it's like pulling you in in the gravity is like a thousand ten thousand times. I've heard that's when it gets like that. So it's like its legit is proven. I don't I don't know why either I don't there's so many things I could just fight it out with one space. I just hate space the idea of dimensions.  That one it's too confusing for now and not nearly smart enough to think about it.
 
Topic 4 story about riding a bird: I remember hearing a podcast that had a story about a kid riding some kind of bird.  I want to find it again.
[5040, 5041, 4224, 1722, 1931, 3178, 1929, 1928, 942, 1675]
0:  Feels weird to stop there doesn't it? And that is because when human beings listen to a couple of actions in a sequence, we want to know what the next one is. It's almost innate what happened after I looked out my window.  You know what? I'm not gonna tell you just kidding. I saw a bird. So obviously I got up this morning. I looked out my window. I saw a bird that is also not a story as anyone who has ever had a conversation with a four-year-old knows a sequence of actions by itself is not a story four-year-olds. They have the sequence of actions down pretty well, but they lack the next element that you need to make a good story a point a point.
1:  You know what? I'm not gonna tell you just kidding. I saw a bird. So obviously I got up this morning. I looked out my window. I saw a bird that is also not a story as anyone who has ever had a conversation with a four-year-old knows a sequence of actions by itself is not a story four-year-olds. They have the sequence of actions down pretty well, but they lack the next element that you need to make a good story a point a point.  Is element number 2 a good story gets to a point the point can come in many forms. It can be a moment of surprise or Revelation or learning. It can be funny. It can be serious. It can be moving. It just has to be the point to which all the actions are leading and the SlamBall story The Point the place where all the actions relating is this they were blown away and then Runway was like I want this I want this on my
2:  Like feeling grossed in something while you're doing other things don't get me wrong. That's amazing and not that you're not multitasking right now listening to me talk but I think that just hearing a story hearing it unfold hearing kind of the stuttering the natural progression of Storytelling is so important. So yeah, I read that today or I thought of it today and I wrote it down in my journal and now I'm reading it to you guys that concept of that we see more stories. I mean here I was texting a client a freelance client and I was like, oh like something something stories thinking about Instagram stories, and it's just so  Because I remember a time where Instagram stories and Snapchat stories didn't exist. I also remember when Instagram stories was a thing became a thing and I was like, oh, I'm never going to betray Snapchat. I love my Snapchat stories. Like I'm never gonna betray Snapchat by going on Instagram stories. No one even uses interim stories. There was a time where not many people used Instagram stories because people don't didn't get that it like pops up at the top. So I think that it's kind of interesting how things have progressed. I wonder if Facebook Stories will ever be a thing. I feel like no, I think we have enough
3:  The thought of what kind of person can attack people like that? Yeah, and you're right. It could be either somebody who is deeply hurt and they want to hurt others. Yeah, that's usually an ace or they're just super naive and they don't know any better. Yeah, because a lot of them do you can tell or you see profile? You see the name that maybe they're just a young stupid kid, right? Yeah. That's just that their parents aren't watching are you know monitor, you know taking  Being careful. Yeah, like they have full access to social media and then they can watch and comment all day long. Well, it's dangerous because when you when you're not talking to someone's face. Well, right. That's what I'm saying is like a young, you know, young kids like I that blows me away what you know, they have complete access for access to do that. And but they're they're the ones that are riding these kind of comments to somebody because we did have a lot of them from younger kids about yeah has a
4:  Have to become the best daughter. I have to become the best girlfriend. I was like, right. Yeah, and I've now learnt like prioritize things. So I prioritize my riding and my relationships over everything else because that to me is like my core values and it's what's yes what's important to me? So you kind of have to choose what you want to prioritize and I know it's very different for everyone else. So for example your job, you might have to prioritize over your right.  Dang, I'm just you've got to learn to not feel guilty about that. I used to very much struggle. If I put all my energy into my riding and then I didn't have the energy to go to the gym. I would look at myself as a failure again. I'll be like, oh, well, you're not keeping up the standards and say I put all my energy into riding and then I was like, oh God, you know what? I can't I haven't got the energy to make this podcast or to make this video or to do this or to reply to those messages. I would feel really
5:  She was in the hospital and she hasn't been back since he's grabbed that that's amazing, but she she has seizures still every week to three weeks. But we just know how to take care of her now and the reason why I wanted to kind of like share that story is because I feel like parents all have a version of that story when their kids are different than what they planned. So if  It Remy also has autism we discovered that when she was two and a half. And so what I've learned by talking to other parents is that that version that trauma that I experienced in that our family experience. It's kind of universal when you have a kid that has special needs and nobody knows what to do. We're all trying to figure it out and nobody.
6:  Look at that as defining the rest of my riding career that I haven't pushed myself that one time. I think it's important to remember one ride is not going to change the outcome. And that again is something that I've had to learn. I've also learned to prioritize the important thing as and so for me because riding is my job my passion and all that I have now.  And I prioritize my horses over say going to the gym or making a new Vlog or kind of ramping up my social media. Whereas before like say even six months ago. I was like I have to be doing everything at top level. I have to become the best business owner have to become the best social media person. I have become the best Rider I
7:  Hang on how tired you are you do sometimes have to push through it because you know, I a lot of the time I'm tired. It's very rare that I kind of go go through a week without hitting a point where I'm like, oh, I'm really exhausted. But I like I said, I'm kind of just like dance in the gray area a little bit more now if I push myself and I can ride then I'm really kind to myself and I'm like well done. That was really good if I don't and I don't push myself through it. I  Look at that as defining the rest of my riding career that I haven't pushed myself that one time. I think it's important to remember one ride is not going to change the outcome. And that again is something that I've had to learn. I've also learned to prioritize the important thing as and so for me because riding is my job my passion and all that I have now.
8:  The most and sometimes you know, it's different every time but often times I wasn't thinking about anything. I was just trying to put one foot in front of the others fast as I could and I remember hearing it interview from Michael Phelps where he was kind of talking about the same thing. People were asking them. What do you think about like when you're swimming in the Olympic Games and his response was like, I'm just think I'm just in the moment just thinking about what I'm doing right now. I'm not like over analyzing things and I found that to be really interesting, you know, because  I think it's really easy to just like think that you have to have some magical thought life to get the most out of yourself, but I think sometimes we gotta just turn our minds off even.
9:  but the way that makes me feel better, I guess in a sense is that  That's their I don't want to say that's their problem. But I mean it is kind of like their gross in that they're doing that. They're being that disgusting. Yeah, but they're going to do that whether we're at the beach weather even even there's people that want to do that the mall they're going to be watching your Ki they are I mean you sure papers out there all over the place. That's what I was going to say their stories all the time about. Oh this pedophile. Yeah in the bathrooms or like you said at the pool, you know, that's been a big one. I mean I've even heard stories of kids in
 
Topic 5 daniel ek interview: Someone told me about a podcast interview with Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, about the founding and early days of Spotify.  I would like to find the show and episode that contains that interview.  Other interviews with Ek are relevant as well.
[519, 520, 1018, 1103, 178, 721, 618, 1017, 755, 1104]
0:  Hello and welcome to start up. I'm Alex blumberg and we are at the third and final episode of startup ever. The last episode of the last season of the very first podcast gimlet ever launched. We're taking you inside the sale of gimlet to the streaming giant Spotify. Just a quick note here at the top. There is some swearing in this episode.  Last episode Matt and I had just come back from a whirlwind trip to Stockholm right before Thanksgiving to meet with Daniel Eck the CEO of spotify and although no one had officially told us this that trip had the feel of a final hurdle before Spotify made an official offer to buy us.

So that was a goal that I kind of set out we both kind of set out early on so we accomplished that and then the other part of it was to just kind of like try different things like our episodes. I totally get in 2019 at times are a little all over the place some people like that. Some of them are interviews. Some of them are getting really into the Weeds on like, you know, the ux design process and the thing is, is that there really  And over like the trend is overall Trends where that people like the interviews no surprise there but people did really like getting deep dives into specific topics. Like the recent episode on user flows had a ton of people listening and commenting on there is episodes on the overall overarching ux design process that episode perform really well. So we're so going to be experimenting with topics. I think the one thing that I hope that we can do is also expand design huddle not just as a ux or podcast or a product manager podcast or

8:  His Connection in Birmingham. There's this like this Melting Pot of cultures and like and and different countries and different people of different nationalities coming together. And so for him, that's how that was his connection to reggae music then I found out that there's going to be a biopic about him and he's like, wow, this is did you interview the interview. I told him I heard there's a biopic being written about you and oh he didn't know that know if you let me finish.  It's my sentence. I promise you won't tell you the story. So basically during the interview I found out that weed through my research that there was a biopic being written about him. So it's like hey, I heard there's a biopic about you and he's like, how do you know it's not been written yet. So they're commissioning it. Obviously they'll they'll contact you when they want to write that one could do something about your life and then I asked him like who would you cast as like who'd played the young Apache Indian and like was kind of fun?

1:  Got history, but it's also like a leap of faith on your side too. Because you thinking about you know, all these people want to come here and like having to deal with you know, whether or not these people actually show up and they actually showed up. What do you say to those people those early people with their Christ most of them probably still patronize you today, but at that moment it was like it was so like I can't even explain like when I started seeing like people trick away.  that was coming from around the tent from around the Avenue or you know, when fat line them came around or you know, just you know that sister from the Masjid or that brother came around and you know, it was just so it was so humbling and I was just so grateful and and they got the same, you know, they got the same Thrill Is they got when I was around eight because like, you know saying conversation and they was a big part of the story, you know I'm saying, so it was just
2:  Whatever their thoughts though. It didn't stop the two lovebirds from eloping early in 1978. There was of course the legal trouble that Martin had gotten into so after the new marriage Martin began serving his six-month sentence still Michelle remained a stalwart wife despite these early signs of trouble and the warnings from her parents.  Besides it wasn't long before Martin was out of jail once more from then on Martin and Michelle worked on building their home life one child at a time. They had biological children to start but soon began to adopt kids as well. In fact, they had begun telling others including their families that the kids they adopted were all from the Ukraine. This was yet another transgression in Deceit by Martin as in reality only one of their adopted children was Ukrainian,
3:  When asked how he found Michelle in the bathtub Martin relayed many different versions of the events that day when he spoke with the paramedics he had said that he had found her hunched over the bathtub with her head inside that scenario though would have not required any assistance when Martin tried to lift her from the tub  Martin had yet, another version of the story for people who asked what happened. He told some that she had likely Fallen while preparing a bath for herself while he told others that she passed out first and then fell in Martin told even another story to one of his daughters saying that Michelle had been fully submerged accept her feet.
4:  Shhhh, whose job it was to ensure that Michelle was in proper shape to be getting the procedure done.  Dr. Welsh noticed that Michelle didn't speak much. In fact, it seemed as though Martin had been doing all of the talking for her throughout the appointment answering questions on her behalf. Dr. Welsh then asked to speak with Michelle alone to which Michelle responded by confiding in the doctor. Once Martin had left. She was very depressed and stressed she stated, but she didn't or couldn't elaborate.
5:  He started to threaten to leave his family a tactic that proved especially damaging. He also took to saying he no longer loved Michelle and worst of all that he didn't want the adopted kids at all anymore his excessive verbal and mental abuse of Michelle was enough to get Michelle thinking she thought specifically that Martin was having an affair. She was right, but the revelations began to get darker Martin was having more than one Affair of course, but there were some that were more  line of the man that Martin really was one such woman was Anna Osborne Walt Hall
6:  Alexis planned on staying at Michelle side to take care of her even sleeping next to her Dear Mother to make sure she was well-managed Martin though would have none of it the day after coming home Alexis found Michelle to be unresponsive after a cursory check on her. She asked Martin about this in Martin told his daughter that he had accidentally overmedicated Michelle.  When Michelle woke, however, she told Alexis a very different story. She said that her husband had kept on feeding her pills until she vomited and she asked her daughter for help.
7:  Michelle reported that she was still unable to open her eyes due to the swelling but that in itself was still normal for a post-op facelift patient four days later. Alexis was due back to Nevada for medical school and she wants again left her mother in the care of Martin. Michelle had yet another meeting with dr. Thompson this time clearly happy with the results. Michelle had once again become self-sufficient walking around and doing things for herself. She was even largely off.  The medications that Martin had taken home to her things. Perhaps were looking up now, perhaps thought Michelle the worst was over.
8:  Dr. Welsh noticed that Michelle didn't speak much. In fact, it seemed as though Martin had been doing all of the talking for her throughout the appointment answering questions on her behalf. Dr. Welsh then asked to speak with Michelle alone to which Michelle responded by confiding in the doctor. Once Martin had left. She was very depressed and stressed she stated, but she didn't or couldn't elaborate.  Dr. Welsh noticed the Michelle very high incidences of blood pressure and he suggested once Martin returned that the couple wait before going through with the surgery.
9:  At this suggestion Martin expressed frustration. He stated that he wanted Michelle to have this operation done as soon as possible. It was also during this consultation that the dr. Michelle discussed her history of heart palpitations.  At this dr. Welsh also showed concern and administered an EKG on Michelle to ensure that she didn't have any evidence of heart disease.

[75, 76, 17, 113, 4092, 125, 112, 4093, 18, 2926]
0:  virgin story  My question is how and why did you move to New York? Because New York so hard place remember to and and like I want to know like, where do you live? How did you pay your rent like that kind of stuff? I had like one of the worst mood in New York stories. I moved here after college first. I'd always wanted to live here. I knew this is where as well if I came here as a ten-year-old and I was like, this is my place where you from home, I grew up in Pittsburgh College in the midwest went to college in Indiana. I got a degree in marketing and advertising. I moved to New York City the week of the market crash in 2008. So I'm sending out.
1:  My question is how and why did you move to New York? Because New York so hard place remember to and and like I want to know like, where do you live? How did you pay your rent like that kind of stuff? I had like one of the worst mood in New York stories. I moved here after college first. I'd always wanted to live here. I knew this is where as well if I came here as a ten-year-old and I was like, this is my place where you from home, I grew up in Pittsburgh College in the midwest went to college in Indiana. I got a degree in marketing and advertising. I moved to New York City the week of the market crash in 2008. So I'm sending out.  Hundreds of resumes and people are laying off their entire advertising division in droves. People are like dissolving their companies. Nobody is paying I mean marketing PR advertising is a luxury if people are just completely decimating their entire divisions that do those things and I was like fuck I moved to New York $5,000. I thought I was a millionaire. I saw that sounds like a pretty rich moves. Yeah. I was like this hot little thing with like TT Ted some like I'm gonna get a hundred jobs and 4 seconds and
2:  But there are ways to find actual real apartments in real opportunities for housing in these groups. So I wouldn't neglect them at all. So once I found my sublet I kind of just packed up my clothes put them on the train and unpacked when I got to New York and then I slowly moved all my stuff from there. I wasn't ready to fully commit to Bringing like my furniture and buying a bed and things like that yet because I was waiting to move into my first own rented apartment with my three best.  Friends from college. So I sublet the apartment then all my friends my three best friends moved to New York and we got an apartment together and I would say we were probably settled in our apartment by August now, so that's kind of the logistics of moving to New York. It wasn't super hard. It wasn't super difficult for me because I ordered all new furniture and I really just had to move my clothes from Philly to New York City, but the hard part came in with the emotional part of it for me. It was really
3:  So that is what I will do today. I will simply talk about New York State not even New York City that probably deserves its own podcast, New York City such a big city.  But I will do New York State and have New York City only a small part of this podcast.
4:  I'm since written 12 books 12 this my 12 book and was the first book you wrote It's called The Streets were paved with gold. Okay, and it was about what happened to New York City Fisk, not only fiscal crisis, but the Flight of the middle class the working class the race, you know polarization and I'm aware of that book. How did it do early on from a successful standpoint. It was not a best seller or some of the other books were but it's a book on proud of it was did it  You on the map from a quality standpoint and the circles you cared about. Well, actually, you know part of it some of it ran on the New York Magazine. This is before the New Yorker in like 75 and I did a piece should the people who hid budget deficits in New York City like the mayor of New York both Lindsay and beam governor. Governor Rockefeller Walter wriston the head of Citibank some of the union leaders. Did they commit fraud right there for a crime?
5:  And we're back talking about the state of New York not New York City the state of New York. The state of New York is the fourth most populous state.  So lot of people live in New York, and of course New York City is the United States biggest city with approximately 8 million people.
6:  So New York state has so much information that I feel it deserves its own podcast.  So that is what I will do today. I will simply talk about New York State not even New York City that probably deserves its own podcast, New York City such a big city.
7:  You on the map from a quality standpoint and the circles you cared about. Well, actually, you know part of it some of it ran on the New York Magazine. This is before the New Yorker in like 75 and I did a piece should the people who hid budget deficits in New York City like the mayor of New York both Lindsay and beam governor. Governor Rockefeller Walter wriston the head of Citibank some of the union leaders. Did they commit fraud right there for a crime?  And Milton Glaser was the name.

8:  Friends from college. So I sublet the apartment then all my friends my three best friends moved to New York and we got an apartment together and I would say we were probably settled in our apartment by August now, so that's kind of the logistics of moving to New York. It wasn't super hard. It wasn't super difficult for me because I ordered all new furniture and I really just had to move my clothes from Philly to New York City, but the hard part came in with the emotional part of it for me. It was really  really hard to wrap my head around not being in college anymore. It was super hard for me to think that like this was going to be my life for the rest of my life waking up every day and going to work and not experiencing new people every single day and having to really put myself out there in order to meet people. It was kind of like a wave of shock like because when you're in college new people and new experiences are constantly thrown at you every single
9:  So there's about a thousand restaurants in New York City that sell or serve foie gras and the restaurants. It's a lot of restaurants, but I'm actually surprised it's not more than that since New York City has a shit ton of restaurants. But anyway, so  This has struck a bomb for I guess local Flora producers in New York Upstate New York. Preferably the Hudson Valley Hudson Valley. Foie gras. I believe is the farm. They produce a lot of foie gras for the country and New York City makes up about 30% of their business according to the New York Times. I'm
