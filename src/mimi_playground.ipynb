But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.\n",

I mean you have the flu does kill them however the flu as far as we know based on current evidence and whatnot is less contagious or at least I should say has a lower are not number meaning. It's it's not spread as easily.  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%\n",
      "3:  Professional looking into the spread agree that it did not come from bat soup rather. This was transmitted through snakes, but this is still not 100% clear.  Most covid most coronavirus has spread the same way other cold causing viruses do through infected people coughing and sneezing touching hands or faces or touching infected objects, like doorknobs utensils shaking hands or any other things you would do as a human in your day-by-day almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life.

Let's talk about how Corona virus spreads infected people can share the virus by coughing sneezing or touching others diligence behind what you're doing in your everyday life can prevent a lot of infections, you know, coughing into your sleeve and not your hand washing your hands Etc. We  Know that people aren't great about keeping their germs to themselves. Yeah. So how worried should we be about Contracting coronavirus? You shouldn't be alarmed by now. There's human to human Transmission in the United States. Like that's what viruses do a recent case of Novel coronavirus in Washington state found that the virus is not only in the lung a lung excretion. So coughing and sneezing. Yes, but it was also found in this individuals fecal matter that's poop. This is another reason why hand washing\n",

      "9:  But this particular virus is new. Wow, that is crazy. So a lot of us might have had one of the other coronaviruses before but not this one. This one is new. So scientists are now naming it. That's right. The Corona virus that's all over the news right now is called the 2019 in Corona virus and that in stands for novel or new. So what that means is that it is new to humans.  And it is new to the phylogenetic tree scientists use the phylogenetic tree to understand relationships. So they may ask is this virus more or less closely related to another virus based on similarity the symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus are cough fever shortness of breath and some patients have even reported having nausea vomiting diarrhea and in some cases symptoms progress to bronchitis or pneumonia, and now that we\n",

Did they engagement inspire you to get home quicker? Yes.  Yes, I asked him if you would marry me he had this romantic response. He said sure why not and from that point on I pretty much wrote around the clock till I get home December 3rd 1999. You completed your journey across the Atlantic at what point? Did you realize this trip was going to be a success? Yeah, probably December first when I saw Guadalupe for the first time in the middle of the ocean because at any point before that, you can always make a mistake that ends it or ends you\n",

Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.  Because with warm water in the atmosphere is damper, that's all drawn up so that you not only get greater wind speeds. But lot more water is poured down on communities when it comes down and it would have been the past. I'm not sure where the original question was here. But I don't know either keep going. Well Greta to finger good. She's saying that that we need to panic about it because the situation is that bad and even if say we were wrong\n",

It's like a regular thing now well water levels are rising around the world because of climate change has occurred just till now and the the speed of it is also a very concerning because I think scientists were saying we wouldn't see a ice-free Arctic North Pole for another 20 or 30 years. I think it's if I have I may be wrong about that but not for 10 or 15 years at least and some  say it could happen this year right for the first time.

If you're going to try to row the North Atlantic to be able to track the Gulf Stream.  Men stay in the Gulf Stream, which is a warm water current that pushes his way toward France. It's one of the things that give southern France its temperate climate is the warm water current that you know sweeps that direction and if you can stay in the Gulf Stream the North Atlantic route can be very fast. When I lost Communications the boat got pushed north of the Gulf Stream.

You became the first woman in American to row across the Atlantic Ocean.  This topic is the focus of your book a pearl in the storm. So let's begin with talking about that Journey. When did you first become interested in rowing? And when did you decide you wanted to row across the Atlantic? So I am was a student at Smith college and there was a woman who had been there for at least 50 years who is like the Sorting Hat of Smith college and I was walking through the athletic complex. I was going to play basketball. I'm 6 feet tall. I'm you know knew I was going to play basketball at college and\n",

You said top-level basketball baseball and football players made more money in 15 minutes playing ball than it would cost me to row across the Atlantic Ocean. What are your current thoughts on the pay Gap and do you believe that the activism in our society today towards the issue is creating a real change for female athletes. Yes. So this last summer  Women, you know the US team win the world cup and there was a lot of discussion about pay for female athletes versus males and the conversation got really ugly and mean and I was asked about sexism or this past summer than I have been in my entire career. The fact is that most sporting pay isn't determined by owners or individual sponsors of teams there to try it Saturn by television.\n",

I think it's true of great musicians great artists if there's something that you're willing to devote a lot of time to something you're willing to suffer for something you have passion for which is Latin pot. He's suffering. So what you're passionate about you're willing to suffer for then you learn a lot from those things you learn the willingness to get knocked down and get up again.  - yourself up and keep going which is resilience as you begin raising money for your second trip.

It's a strange still giant, you know that and subdivision. I'll tell you why it isn't done and this relates to some of the questions you sent me. What what we can do is in relates back to Extinction rebellion, and Greta is  People have to speak up and not just to friends and family and stuff like that. They have to speak out and speak up and show up. Just imagine next Friday right have the second part of the global climate strike on this.

      "0:  Scientists, we're actually not learning a lot about black holes from this image because it's so close to the predictions that were already made. So I guess it's kind of a good thing and a bad thing and this is sort of a picture in a goal 13 years in the making the Event Horizon telescope project was launched in 2006. So it's a pretty huge accomplishment and a question that I had sort of thought of as why did not why didn't we take a picture of the black hole in our own Galaxy that black  Liz called Sagittarius A and it's actually pretty small compared to some of the other black holes that we know of and although the m87 black hole is 50 3.5 million light years away that's actually relatively close and we were able to take a picture of it. And this also means that we can do future research about black holes by adding more dishes to get a sharper image and they also want to do more images over time to see how black holes are changing which is research that\n",
      "1:  Please know about black holes already. Guess what what in in the class we were in the morning class. Yeah, you guys see the first black hole that was like ever discovered that I was ever like like like ever photographed. Oh, wow, cool, and it was the first one. Yeah. That's right. That's right. That's happened. Pretty recently. I was the only one yeah.  I remember hearing about when that happened. I took a picture of a black hole a video of it. Well, cool. I'm sorry real black hole. Wow, that's really cool. And we also got to see one. That's how black hole works. Oh, that's cool.\n",
      "2:  Are you are you muted welcome back to launch pad astronomy. I'm Christian ready your friendly neighborhood astronomer. And you are live on telescope talk Pro where we take astronomy seriously very Souls. Um, that's right. How exciting is this we get to we are now embarking on an opportunity. Well rather rather kind of back up a little bit, but just for my viewers we have talked at Great length about black holes on this channel and we talk about black holes all the time in physics and astronomy.  And it's great to talk about black holes. We've seen tremendous evidence for black holes. We've never actually seen a black hole and that's for good reason because black holes aren't by definition black. They swallow all of the light that falls into it. So how does one actually see a black hole and the short answer is you don't but you see what is immediately surrounding or rather see the shadow of the black hole and for the first time ever astronomers are in the process of doing just that taking an image as Tony said of the\n",
      "3:  In the m87 Galaxy but I think we would be able to find how big the actual Galaxy is. So they look into that. Thank you. Another reason that this is important is because it come it confirms these ideas that scientists have had about black holes that shelf and kind of talked about with Albert Einstein. So these predictions about the theories of general relativity that are centuries older actually being finally confirmed which is pretty cool. And although this image is may be cool for those of us who aren't  Scientists, we're actually not learning a lot about black holes from this image because it's so close to the predictions that were already made.

Yeah, I'm taking that is it but that is literally one of the questions was no wrong answer. All right, which one of these two ladies is the baddest bitch in the room Michelle Obama or Beyonce Michelle Obama, but that's also a tough one brown sugar or Lady Lady. How did you by the way wind up manage you manage the angel said? Yeah short spells, so  Dominic Kinnear God Rest his soul how many times do I say that throughout?

He thinks we met I don't think we did and\n",
      "4:  Funny of that episode title was Michelle Obama. What would a Michelle Obama do but yeah, but it was perfect. I love Michelle Obama to I think she's I mean and so many ways. I think she's almost like just the perfect first lady because she definitely has an opinion. She is not afraid to be herself. She is confident. She's active. She's got those guns and is proud of them. She dresses. Well, she's beautiful. So I mean I get it. I just don't find myself every 15 minutes thinking what would Michelle Obama did this?  But maybe I will maybe that's where I'm going wrong in life. Maybe so we've got sort of a lot going on. I guess we could I think we should kind of start with Todd. So there's still that with Todd and Kandi. There's kind of a lot going on there. What was your take on everything? I mean my take is Todd is a dick. I really want to like him and I haven't again like this last season.\n",

Oh shit. It's like one gotta go so I can only pick one. You can only pick up. I got it Beyonce. Well, it depends on  A sketch. Okay. I got you pop like make this complicated Beyonce Oprah. Oh Michelle Obama only have one. That's bullshit. It's my show you right? Okay, I can only own one. That's what's the sketch about whatever I want wherever you want.

      "6: Hi everyone, this is Dom and Ivana. And this is Kathy Tucker. Welcome to our very first episode of brown girls read today. We are discussing her thoughts on Michelle Obama's Memoir becoming it's one of the best books. I have read so far and I can't wait to share it with you all. Come on. Do you want to share a quick synopsis? Before we start? Sure Michelle Obama is an American lawyer a university administrator and a writer who was the first lady of  the United States from 2009 to 2017 becoming is a deeply personal Memoir where she writes about her upbringing dreams marriage children and life experiences. It's sold over 10 million copies and was a best-selling book in 2018. I can see why I loved this book.

Just having watched the most recent Atlanta episode and it was I think Raw on many levels. I mean there is a lot of heavy topics being discussed on there, but we've got a lot of going on between Kandi and Todd with their daughter / stepdaughter. We've got really  Kind of hard to sit through conversations with Dennis and Porsche and then we've just got Michelle Obama sprinkled throughout I thought that was the most random thing. I'm like, why is Michelle Obama being brought up every 15 minutes? I mean, I think because Michelle Obama is I feel like the Jesus. It's like she just she just is wise and I feel like she's obviously well respected, but then her own community so definitely. Yeah, and I'm Memoir but yeah, no, I agree those and\n",

There was Starbucks in the lobby there were  Liberties in the line in front of you at the cafeteria and I was about to make this choice. I literally thought I was going to die. I felt like I was going to die that entire month and yet thank goodness. You know, I talked to the same friend as honey how there's certain people you probably have this to in your life who are just pivotal and the things they do. So the one who said that cart.

      "4:  Given how well the two women clicked. It's no wonder that Anna agreed to accompany Marta to New York City to meet a friend for dinner in December of 1984. And it's also not surprising that Anna trusted this acquaintance of Marta's implicitly. What did come as a shock to Anna at least was that the person she met that evening wasn't a friend of Marta's at all. He introduced himself as an office.  Of the Cuban intelligence service Marta revealed that she was actually a recruiter for the agency and they wanted to engage on Anna as a Cuban spy.\n",

I mean publishing is  a funny business where they you kind of believe there's nothing but New York, you know, it's like these New York is the center of everything. There's just no other place you could live maybe La if you want to do the film side of the business, but otherwise you have no options and so I believe that and was struggling and and found the Shambhala Center and I just was there every single weekend.

So the red prediction line is way above the green real price in the updated chart bye-bye to you. So  And if you look at the model that was fitted on all the data, so including the the data from 2014 until today that a Cheeburger is using then you see much lower model. So the model came down significantly and of course now it really fits well, but my prediction would be that it will have to be updated again after 2020 for huffing. And so the stability of the parameters is a key thing for me.\n",
      "2:  Bet actually the run-up will come in 2021 would you say that's a fair statement or what's your view there? Yeah, I think that's a fair statement. But but formerly the model does not say anything about it. So there's no short term prediction. There is no prediction of the all-time high or the next Peak. There's also no prediction of the low the only thing that you can take from the model, is that you  You have the cointegration and it will stick very close to the stock to flow level. And so somewhere before say Christmas 2021. The price should be above a hundred thousand if we take that third last model or above fifty fifty five thousand if you take the original model, so that's in fact, the only thing that you can you can take from the model and where the next half inning is or where the next all-time highest. Sorry.\n",

So so it's yeah, it's definitely interest. It's interesting model. The only thing is first there is a big difference in predictions between stock to flow model and this  This time based model. Like you said the time based models are lower in prediction so in it's very interesting to see maybe not this whole thing. But especially after 2020 for housing the models really deviate from each other. So we'll see which one is right very exciting but more importantly now, is that what I don't like about the time model and why?\n",
      "4:  Talk about the timing. So typically what we have seen looking historically is the first having was roughly mid 2012 and then 2013 was where we saw the big bull runs happen. Then the next one was in mid-2016. And then again, we saw the bull runs happen in 2017 or what rather one big bull run. Let's call it. So would you say then that if you were to copy paste that same pattern the having next time around will be mid 2020s.  Bet actually the run-up will come in 2021 would you say that's a fair statement or what's your view there? Yeah, I think that's a fair statement.

Well, you can't you could that's not a reliable strategy. You can't get in on something. So random that  You're relying on that prediction to come true. What we need to do is rather than to try and predict what the stock is going to do. We need to react to what it is doing and there are ways of doing that when there are strategies that you can Implement that basically a disregard all of the ones are speculative, you know Gamble's and only focus on the type of stock setups that are more likely to work where the the difficulty comes.\n",

There's no guesswork or there shouldn't be any guesswork in the in the equation if anybody tells you that a stock is definitely going to get to this point then they're either perhaps slightly deluded or they're lying or they just want to come across in a certain way for whatever whatever the case may be. No.  Buddy knows what a sock is definitely going to do. So we need to take out that prediction in the first place.

So without any change on parameters, so that's for me. Is it crucial thing? Yeah, that is a really fascinating thing and it speaks to whether there is some kind.\n",
