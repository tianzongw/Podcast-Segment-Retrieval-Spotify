In fact of pneumonia and CIP and previous epidemics coronaviruses, or see small ovie's enveloped positive.\n",
      "1:  You could potentially get infected. Oh, wow, but Catherine says that other similar coronaviruses that we know about. They mostly don't spread through the air. She thinks this disease is spreading a different way. So most Corona viruses are spread through droplets, somebody coughs or sneezes, they form a respiratory droplet and that comes in contact with someone their eyes. They breathe it in they touch their mouth something like that with droplet transmission the droplets fall pretty quickly there.\n",
      "2:  Huh. Now there's lots of Corona viruses circulating in the world. So there's human coronaviruses and there's lots of different animal coronaviruses that don't infect humans very well or at all.\n",
      "3:  But this particular virus is new. Wow, that is crazy. So a lot of us might have had one of the other coronaviruses before but not this one. This one is new. So scientists are now naming it. That's right. The Corona virus that's all over the news right now is called the 2019 in Corona virus and that in stands for novel or new. So what that means is that it is new to humans.\n",
      "4:  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.\n",
      "5:  You are saying bye for now from authentic biochemistry. Listen up in the next day or two. I'm going to finish off on coronaviruses.\n",
      "6:  And those include things like viral protease Azure or the host Proteus has because their receptors Halima races like the polymerase for the Corona virus and even the in Tripoli like Spike protein. So vaccines have only been approved for a few of these viruses the IV be the tgv and the canine coronavirus, but those vaccines are out are not always used because of Novel pathogenic coronaviruses that arise because of recombination of circulating.\n",
      "7:  It could become more and more infectious to a human. So thinking about that, right? The first documented case of 2019 in coronavirus was reported in Wuhan China at an Open Marketplace. And there are a variety of ways that it could have infected people there. The second thing is how do you get a bat and a human physically close enough to transfer the virus, you know, you can pick up bat poop in a cave and sequence tons of coronaviruses. I mean, so anyway,\n",
      "8:  And RNA viruses course, they're characterized by this club like spikes that project from their surface because of that under a microscope that can look like the sun's Corona like an eclipse. So either called coronaviruses. They have an unusually large RNA genome and the replication strategy is in the cytosol.\n",

Some other viruses act like this. So for measles for example, if you walk into a room where someone with measles has been even within two hours, you could potentially get infected.

And I think sometimes you can't force that on, you know, you have to really find those things for real and know when they are for real because you know not unlike this falling for these relationships were talking about where your radar is not catching. But it again why I think about Adam and Greta and Francis being a kind of but a happy thing that was because I did feel like\n",
      "1:  Time especially in Show Business Keller was already famous and David bacon had his eyes set on being a movie star in the 1940s. Even being suspected of being gay could be a career-ending scandal. However, it's likely that David and Greta did have some affinity for one another this is evidenced by the fact that by the fall of 1943 Greta was pregnant with David's child the two lived in a mansion on Lookout Mountain and David would often make the long drive.\n",
      "2:  Improving our sustainability records globally. We he will be doing the right thing and time will only tell now it's interesting that one thing that you know, Greta is doing is obviously going by boat around and saying no one should fly probably I think it's unrealistic with the the need for for Global connectivity. I think but you know as a frequent flyer self myself to we're both kind of guilty. What are you doing to reduce your carbon footprint?\n",

      "2:  And it's great to talk about black holes. We've seen tremendous evidence for black holes. We've never actually seen a black hole and that's for good reason because black holes aren't by definition black. They swallow all of the light that falls into it. So how does one actually see a black hole and the short answer is you don't but you see what is immediately surrounding or rather see the shadow of the black hole and for the first time ever astronomers are in the process of doing just that taking an image as Tony said of the\n",

There's a name of our black hole together black hole of our galaxy and that's the closest one we have.\n",

It is something that is simply does not exist having no physical proof of a black hole or any evidence that it exists where we were showing a depiction of what a black hole looks like with no actual pictures of a black hole when really look,\n",

I didn't realize that you know, this has been something that they've had theories about four years, but they didn't really have any proof until so recently so cool. Thanks. Johan speaking about recently. There has been some major breakthroughs in current events with black holes, seeing as the first-ever photo of a black hole well photo in air quotes of a black hole blue.\n",

It sucks in everything in its path debris dust planets light and the way a black hole is formed is when a star dies and collapses in on itself. I got some stuff to throw in a black hole.
