1:  He said there had never been a president who had been as transparent Chris Butler reports from Washington in a phone call in July. Donald Trump did ask the Ukrainian president to start an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. He claims that a rough transcript of the discussion choose. There was no pressure put on volodymyr zelanski Democrats. No want full details of an earlier call between the presidents from April to be published allegations that the president misused his position by threatening to withhold hundreds of  millions of dollars of aid
2:  I don't like those guys. Those guys are my boys, but I cannot believe we have this Darth Vader guy in the fucking white house. When I say Darth Vader, I'm not saying I'm against him or I'm for him. But you have to admit we got a guy that's living in the 80s being the president in this fucking thing. You know what I mean? He's talking to the Ukrainian president. I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened. I'm gonna go touch with Jen tell him what happened you pretend you're the random rancid polisher.  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.
3:  so he's going after Biden. So he's basically telling the Ukrainian president. You'll give me shit on bite in and if you give me shit on bite and I'll give you fucking money. So that's like some fugged out gangster shit. You can't do that. Right? So the difference between the molar report which was going on for the last three or four years when they're trying to take him down and the difference between this is they actually got a taped conversation or they got some some messages. So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.
4:  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.
5:  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos? What the fuck's going on that damn, right? I don't want to see that. So he's trying to get dirt on Joe Biden because in Donald Trump sighs Joe Biden is the only one that he thinks kid what the beat him can beat him. Yeah, you know that the angle is he's not trying to get dirt on Elizabeth Warren, right? He thinks Bernie Sanders is fucking gone. He just thinks
6:  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people  Idiots, I had to look at things differently. You will come this November when you're voted out because she was actually one of them that turn that seat. I don't think it's going to go. She ain't going to win this next one day and I think the Democrats lose the house they swore in Chief Justice John Roberts and 99 of the 100 Senators who will serve as jurors were sworn in what happened to the other Senator, huh?
7:  Didn't ever Morales looking exposed and weakened. He can no longer rely on the police to protect him control the street protests after forces in three cities joined calls for his resignation his main rival Carlos Messer has rejected an offer of dialogue insisting on new elections and his resignation. Bolivia's armed forces have said they will never go against the people and the crisis must be sold by Democratic means with all sides in the conflict in Bolivia deadlocked it's hard.  See, however Morales can resolve the situation a day after being freed from prison the former left-wing Brazilian president Luiz inacio Lula da Silva has made a trench and attack on the right wing incumbent. Shy able to narrow addressing cheering supporters. Lula said Mr. Boss tomorrow was impoverishing working class Brazilians in favor of what he termed the militias in Rio de Janeiro President Trump says, he's likely to yield to Democrat demands and release the transcript of a second phone call with the Ukrainian president on Tuesday.
8:  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos?

9:  This to where it is today if Hunter didn't freaking get a job off his daddy and get millions of dollars. Maybe he wouldn't have made to ask to be investigated Dingle explain that supporting impeachment was necessary despite the potential repercussions. Yeah, you're going to lose your seat in Michigan because Trump is not above the law. Neither is Joe Biden hundred Biden and delete 30,000 emails Hillary Clinton and that there was a credible case that the  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people
 
Topic 10 boeing 737 crash causes: The Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliner was grounded worldwide after hundreds of people died in two crashes in 2019.  What were people saying about the airline and the company?  What were speculated causes of the crash?  What did people think the effect would be on Boeing’s reputation?  News is relevant, but so is speculation.
0:  He may run out people to fight eventually. They may be a the Amana have to fight the area next time it was shot for the rest of the franchise. I think it meant fide already final finale it meant six the final final finale and it meant seven confirmed by stop final and you cannot find it anymore finale then after that. I maybe we'll get a hit man precursor it boy the birth of it men from it boy to eat man Jane you do under international news the similarities between  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight.

1:  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight. Apparently the FAA was so underfunded. They started to let Boeing certify their own brains. Well away own self check on self Syria, of course Boeing will pass their own airplanes are especially if you can tell your customers a our new 737 Max aircraft ever known only as  the simulator training one save money on training by our new planes just one hour on the iPad for each pilot. I will do and because we are bowing I declare it's not a new aircraft just a variant of the old one. I'm not even making the iPad training part a blur. I wish I was it's not even 1 hour is 56 minutes training on an iPad in reality a the 737 Max her is new in many ways. And also now allegedly flawed tragically flawed.
2:  Since it's become more and more apparent that hey, this is a these were not flukes. This was not just a coincidence that two of them crashed in a relatively short time period but rather there were some major design flaws that Boeing very well may have been knowledgeable of that. They knew that this was a crappy airplane and that scared a lot of people and and you know at this point, it's the 737 Max is grounded. It's not fine. In fact  And so far as to that Boeing is shutting down production of the 737 Max, you know in this is, you know, economically speaking a huge company here in the United States and and the you know, if this continues I mean it's going to legitimately cut into economic growth. We're talking to a few basis points or whatever few tens of basis points a camera of his Kudlow or something else that was recently talking about that and it's obviously not going to be better. I mean Boeing tries to put a
3:  Really going to be something that people want to fly on or that Airlines will want to use I think airlines are may be smart enough or maybe just careless enough or whatever to say. Like, wow, it's good enough for us. But if they know that passengers aren't going to like it then they might just not use it and and even some have been wondering you know, Boeing has another one. I think it's the 777x longer range obviously larger.  That may have some of the same design flaws and maybe that's a story to follow in the future. But anyways, so there's this problem here with with the obviously Boeing and how that plays into the economy and whatnot. But the other thing that I found just fascinating so recently Boeing basically asked for about ten billion dollars in a loan, right and that adds to a pretty large amount of liabilities already, which I'll go over here in a second in addition to a nine point five billion dollar line of credit in October.
4:  Right and our first episode most people who survived were sitting in the mid cabin section. Yep, right in the middle. Yep.  There's no great part of the plane to sit in it's completely unpredictable per each crash. Yep. It depends on where it crashes how crashes how hard it it crashes if type of Crash. Yeah, if I bring back my ear. Yeah, it has been basically undetermined of what seat is safest to sit in there basically isn't one. Yeah, I guess I have a question. I mean his someone published a study on what if there is a safest part and determined that there is no like statistically significant safest.
5:  I don't know. That's where we're at today. It's just a question of when will this be escalated further get now? There's also the question of this airliner that was shot down in a neuron following are actually sort of during all these things going on last night. It was a civilian airliner Ukraine International Airlines or something along those lines. And if I remember correctly it was inbound for Ukraine we  This shot down the official story from Iran which thus far cannot be verified by anyone was that it had mechanical failures and crash. But of course such high mean is peculiar. I mean, it's it would be quite The Coincidence, of course a hundred eighty people lost their lives. So you have to ask you know, what? What was the meaning behind us? I don't think it would be a neurons best interest to say that this was some form of Revenge and I don't know. I don't know. I mean there's a lot of Canadians on the board. I mean, I guess you could say Ukraine is a bit of it.
6:  Okay, speaking of plane crashes Ashley. So evidently they used real bones, like real human corpse bones for the that like flooded pool scene in the original film. That's so gross. And so in the second movie one of the guys that was the main character there. He he's an he gets in a plane crash like he's just in a regular plane and the plane goes down and he survives but he's 1 out of  Out of like that plane crash kills like 27 out of 51 people on the plane. Holy shit, which is wild also again, like maybe planes just weren't that safe. I don't know. I don't know either. They don't sound very safe. You know what? I mean? Yeah, so also, okay. So from the original movie that little blond girl she died at 12. Yay from like flu-like symptoms or whatever she times so I guess like the 80s. Yeah. She died.
7:  There's no great part of the plane to sit in it's completely unpredictable per each crash. Yep. It depends on where it crashes how crashes how hard it it crashes if type of Crash. Yeah, if I bring back my ear. Yeah, it has been basically undetermined of what seat is safest to sit in there basically isn't one. Yeah, I guess I have a question. I mean his someone published a study on what if there is a safest part and determined that there is no like statistically significant safest.  Heart during a crash I'm sure there is but you have to look it up. Yeah, let's do a meta-analysis on this. There you go. You can take that on while I study for your test under the investigators eventually looked into many possibilities. Why would the airplane have broken up there were nine possibilities given. Yeah, it's a list there were nine possibilities that the decided to look into the first one being mid-air Collision, but there were five.
8:  I have the exact details around the Kobe Bryant crash helicopter crash, right? So I apologize for that. We have nothing but the utmost respect and just our hearts are so broken. It seems to just get worse and worse that the other people on board, you know, there were six nine total victims and six other people including Kobe and his  is his incredible daughter as well as a baseball coach named John out to Bellow his wife one of their daughters a woman who Christina Mauser who was an assistant basketball coach a woman named Sarah trust her and her daughter. So I mean, it just makes me wanna cry it just gets worse and worse. As you know, that the podcast wasn't specifically about that about the crash. We it was more of a
9:  Vince at this point that it is contained or that it will resolve. And in fact, I think there's there's a lot of reason to be skeptical and to you know, say that this is maybe actually worse and then what governments are saying it is I mean imagine that right but moving on the other thing I did want to talk about was bowing now Boeing has been in the news for like a long time now, I don't know exactly how far back this this 737 Max situation goes back to but of course the  To sum it up for those of you that have been living under a rock for the last year or whatever. Basically the 737 Max is a new pretty efficient model of the 737 that Boeing put out marketing is basically I mean just that efficient, right the 737 is kind of like quickly about Spotify which generally is known as a music platform, but also now hosts podcasts including yours truly in fact on Spotify you can listen

Topic 12 imran khan career: Imran Khan is the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, and had a career as an international cricket star.  What have people said about his career and achievements?
0:  Prime Minister of Pakistan like about the 1992 World Cups just dinner right? He's unlocked some doors. He's full value on Twitter though. Like I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but he he's not afraid slate opinion most recently about Shahid Afridi decision to the band his daughters from playing Cricket. Yeah, that's quite a lot of trolling or shared freely going on there. That's an area we  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.
1:  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in
2:  Those steps my senses that Masood Azhar may be treated with the same kind of indulgence. But Pakistan would have to demonstrate its own quote unquote good faith in relation to the financial action task force. So while it would be desirable to have a country like Pakistan supporting this kind of an Endeavor in a very very sincere way. The reality is that Pakistan's own internal patterns preferences choices both political and otherwise are inhibiting meaningful cooperation because they are also aware that  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.
3:  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi.

These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.  In being part of the global Endeavor, we will have a situation where they could be more like a horse you were talking about a small D's reports are not very encouraging. It's apparently one of the nation's from where large number of people have gone and join the Islamic State their comeback. Now these attacks in Sri Lanka you're referring to reports in the media elsewhere about how there is an interconnected or there are some traces of connection. So to say between India and these people who have carried out these strikes now once you know, I make an ism like this comes
4:  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.  Um, so that's a little bit of the back story of the great creaking nation of Pakistan. I think you are everyone should be Brewing Pakistan. It would make their day if they want the bulk up. Yeah, there's not being international cricket played there for a number of years because security reasons, they finally get back to that position where actually the safety in their main cities is good. Yep, and they want people to come back and play like it's huge thing is over. I love Pakistani. Yeah. I mean I think offering them they're my favorite team in the tournament as do you say
5:  Of the great spells of bowling. I mean India or otherwise, I mean Malcolm Marshall how it doesn't get better than that, right? Who wants to go next? Visit Vijay? Yes it hello everyone. This is Vijay are moving from Sydney. I'm going to pick Roger Binny from 1987 the second test match between India and Pakistan. So Imran Khan's Pakistan visited India for a five test series against couple days Indians. This was before  The Reliance cup so this happened in the January February timeframe of 1987 after the high scoring draw in the first test match and Madras 1987 the Caravan moved to Eden Gardens Calcutta back, then it was Calcutta still and Sunil gavaskar refused to play at the Eden Gardens citing the crowd trouble that happened in the 8485 test match against England and Imran Khan having won the toss put India in thinking. Okay. There is no Galveston. Let me get some early wickets.
6:  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in  And your you can hear a pin drop in that Pakistan dressing room. Nobody's talking to anybody. They all looking at their feet. All the players in one corner is Imran. And he said Sonny talks briefly to me and then he looks up and so this team from Pakistan was supposed to take the flight out that evening that night come to Bombay.
7:  Which descended on the Gaddafi that moment when the last you know, when the match was decided is something that takes me back and it was like Gloom had descended and I feared okay. I have no idea what might happen next. Yeah, people might you know, start a riot out of sheer disappointment within a few minutes wailing started people started crying specially the Jannah section where the women were sitting they couldn't believe it at all and I was in a very in a sense a privileged position.  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.
8:  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India. So in that perspective Benny spell was a really important one to help India to get some psychological advantage of a Pakistan against a very  be strong batting lineup and also another interesting thing. I don't know if that played any part be a ten-year-old. I heard the word smog the first time in my life are Morgan the famous journalist who covered the game for the Hindu in the sport star, he wrote in that particular weekly saying the smoke cleared and the brief started coming from the hooghly and the calculations are filled up the stands with 70,000 people and the Metro was serving the city like London and Paris and Roger Binny put on a royal show here.
9:  Using bit of a natural element he was able to reduce Pakistan to very manageable first Innings total that helped India to set it up in terms of the game. Unfortunately, India couldn't finish the game off and Pakistan happened to save that game despite being getting another two wickets. So in that particular spell I'm talking about it took six 456 including four four nine four four nine against a very powerful batting lineup in Indian conditions has to be applauded because he wasn't  Or really quick poll.

This order of the brim of the sixties and moods drops Target system and which causes large amounts of the plum and the Brain chemical that helps regulate emotion and feelings of pleasure to flow the brain the slow down. The blame of is what causes a high and it is one of the main causes of drug addiction.
7:  It has been nine months and he has started desperately contacting me. He hasn't done any work on himself. He hasn't been to a counselor for his PTSD. I'm suspicious. He might have a prescription drug addiction Okay, so we've got major issues here to major issues here.  PTSD and prescription drug addiction and my guess is that your hunches probably right so
8:  I'm business as far as I'm concerned exactly daily life. I can imagine can be a Minefield when you're in recovery. So now I've got a lot a lot of lot of time. I feel like all the personal development workshops should be delivered by people in recovery. We should be giving them way more money to turn what's happening in the recovery Community into tools. We use at schools Etc not least because there has been so little money and so many extraordinary things.  Things are done and the creativity of the average key worker is yeah absolutely blows my mind even now if I go into a drug and alcohol service, it doesn't matter how many cool, you know cooler things. I get invited to whatever I'm going to drug and alcohol service and I come out and I think this is Magic. This is absolute magic.

Absolutely. So finally, I'm going to ask you if you could meet you in 10 years time. What do you hope she'd say to you?
 
Topic 14 near death experiences: I wonder if people have shared near-death experiences in podcast episodes.  I would like to find and listen to some stories.  I am not interested in the science of near-death experiences.
0: Singing experience where women gather for the purpose of deep connection and soul nourishment in my living room environment.

For those of you who are maybe new to the term Soul Care or spiritual Direction. I think the best way that I could describe this is spiritual direction. Is this Co companioning

3:  And they're amazing staff has just been such a gift. And so I humbly say thank you and I think it's just one most beautiful parts of the story. And so this podcast is a gift and it's my joy to offer it back to you as a gift gift. And so what can you expect with listening to pasture Experience Podcast? You know, why would you want to join us here? And and here's really my heartbeat. My heartbeat is to take the  The culture that we have right now the culture that we we talked at one another and we listen last and I want to take that and I want to turn that upside down. I'm a bit of a status quo Shaker upper if you will and so a lot of my journey has been one of desperately needing a safe space to wrestle and process and listen and I think that unless we intentionally make time for that. It's so much easier to
4:  Anyways, we can go on and on I can speak forever because it's experience with speaks. It's not that bookish knowledge, which I have. So thank you so much. Ron it for having me on the show and I loved it. Yes, so that's the thing right now and we will like to wrap up this podcast episode now and this will be also uploaded on your vodka straight. Yep. So if anyone from you know that it would be it would have the title like the last day why ironic magnani got fired.  That's something like people will go crazy about this week. Actually exactly ronit magnani got fired after three months from digital printing brand and the you know, when like they have reached this point where this podcast coding and exactly story was completely devoid of this is the front and then I'll have my audio targeted in the podcast will start. So is anyone from the digital printing universe is on my podcast because he also alluded that on his
5:  And then the next episode will lead up to a conversation with somebody that I'm inspired by in their Journey that has to do with the episode before so that's sort of how I'm going to set up these times that we're going to listen first pay attention to what's going on inside of us and then I'll invite us to join this Soul nourishing conversation with a guess that I've invited on which I cannot wait to introduce you to some of the people that we have they are.  Incredible and have life experience and ironically so many of them would we had conversations shared about their experience with experiencing peace and hearing God's voice the majority of that came in the hardships and in the Stillness and in the unknowns and I just think there's a hunger that so many s of so many of us have to know him and experience. Hope glimmers and we're looking for those.
6:  So I'm a deacon heart and so I don't see myself doing anything. Cuz what I meant to do, I think I'm life. He goes t on my past experiences in life. So next ten years ago. If you tell me what are you going to do? What do you want to do? I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be doing some salsa and data science, right? I saw as you know life is a straight line, but they tell you the straight line, but it's never really straight line. It wasn't for me for sure. Yeah. So what's going to be was like trial and error and try what works for you with this.  Work for me. I have a different personality than a typical engineer. The reason why I was playing moves from a political engineering physician. I felt like I needed to the social interaction. I needed that part of my job. So that's something that was I could have stood out from my peers. I kind of wanted to talk and I wanted to put them and that wasn't something that's a lot of people shared with me. And so I didn't know this was the case for me. So I think we're probably know we don't have a lot of role models in our field. We had a lot of black males.
7:  You know that think that was like my whole I'm very interested in Joker in this in this anime. Like he's though he's the wild wild card. He even said like to the doctors like you gonna I built to find the basement that already because he went to go looking for I guess clues or some shit like me, even the scientist guy who's like listen if I even if I did like they're not ready. So yeah, so that's why he kind of  Dov I think was the scientist that gave the idea Shinra should go train with yeah. Yeah, so there's more to them that I I mean that makes a joker I mean Joker in The Sciences be the wild card in this story. Yeah. I don't know either of them are like their own thing. They're like neutral I guess.
8:  The up. Yeah, I think we have so much to discuss and I'm so excited to be back with an episode that I am hundred percent behind fully confident in I love this episode and we haven't for this in the long time. It's really funny because I always like during her summer breaks and sometimes just when I'm like bored out of my mind selfishly. I like listen to her old podcasts and I feel like we said the exact same thing the beginning of season 3.  And season 3 happen and then we're like okay that but I do feel like this definitely had a Vibe was only for the guys to something different one of the things that Roberto and like I think some of the cast was saying that like this episode as like a standalone episode and I was likewise and alone like we're just keep doing what you just did. Like don't be so lonely bring it into the other episodes so alone because it was so well done and like they just they just nailed the tone of what this episode was supposed to be.
9:  to sell services or things like that. It's whole another level of like doing ads like it's branding right when you brand yourself so much just like and this is what I have learned from obviously the Gary we like I don't read books. I don't go to courses. I don't go to anywhere. I just consume like ask him the moment you enter the car today. What was I doing Gary Audio experience? I was just listening in the car Gary Vee audio experience. I was dming people. I was tweeting what I was  I actually posted something right now. We are almost like 20 minutes into this podcast episode and let's see my latest face or Instagram post which is like 29 minutes ago. Right? I posted this particular thing. I was creating it on over application. And then I was just doing this. I was tweeting I did this LinkedIn content. I did three to four platform content and then like I didn't even realize that he came like he knocked the car in order to window and then I had to unlock the
 
Topic 15 podcast about podcasts: I would like to start a podcast.  What equipment do I need?  What kind of microphone?  What sort of space should I use to record?  What software is most helpful?  What are some tips and tricks for using my voice well?  I’d like to hear general tips about recording and producing podcasts.
0:  Into and inspirational end-of-the-year message. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?  I need you know, how how do I do this? Because I had no clue. So what I got from my research was that we needed a good set of microphones. They told me that audio is important. They meaning Google and all the YouTube tutorials on podcasting what I got from it was that audio was important considering that a hundred percent of the time you're going to be listening to our voices. So if our voice is all you hear the night,
1:  I have done it but you know, you don't want to set yourself up and not like stick with something and then you have like this really expensive Mike or this make you don't really know how to use so I believe in starting like, you know where you can and then eventually over time getting better. I've had so many people who started listening to getting there. Like wow, your quality is improved. You sound so much more confident, you know, even though I have the same microphone that I have. Yeah, it's just like, you know, it's cool to see that progression and you don't need to be perfect from the beginning and that's  Something something that holds a lot of people back like I have a couple people that are friends or clients are like I've been wanting to start a podcast but XYZ excuse and I'm like, okay but like you can start and then you get better over time and then people are like wow, that's cool. I mean obviously you can't have like the crappy as audio quality because no one's going to listen. Yeah. No just start start where you can you don't need to splurge and buy the most expensive equipment from the get-go. If you don't if you can't afford it or don't want to afford it. Yeah, that makes sense.
2:  Let's get right into it. Oh, we had a topic in mind that we originally wanted to start off with but after yesterday's ordeal after yesterday's or deal with trying to set up this podcast. I think it's fitting that we tie our drama from yesterday.  Into and inspirational end-of-the-year message. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?
3:  Um to question, we refinish the entry in a couple of minutes and you walk outside and you realize that all of your platforms have been hijacked or hacked or deleted or something like that. Where do you start? You know again, do you start the podcast again or do you start on Instagram or where you go? What would you do?  Yeah, I would definitely I would definitely start the podcast again. I don't know if in this in this world I had I still have all my connections. But if I do on it, I don't think it would be too tricky at all to get a podcast back up and running and honestly, like it's so easy to build out other platforms. Once you have a podcast because then you can start leveraging other people's platforms. It's so important like when you have a podcast and like I interviewed so many today who had like a million and a half followers on Instagram and he reposted my story and his story.
4:  So of you know recording your podcast and starting out, did you have any mentors or people to kind of help you out or you looked up to for advice? Not really there weren't really shy but anybody the podcasting space in particular that I was really looking up to when I was figuring out how to structure my show as far as like the different segments and stuff. I went through and listen to a bunch of different peoples podcasts and really just took notes on like how they structure their show. Do they ask the same questions every time.  Time do they what do they do differently? Like how does their intro sound like what about music? So yeah when I was going through I definitely did that it a lot of research but there was never really any anybody in particular that I listen to very frequently or like that. I really look up to in the space. I definitely take a little bit from everywhere the the one podcast that I will listen to like every episode of is he had my let show I really like what he's doing with his podcast. So he's definitely one that I look up to the most I used to listen to Gary bees podcast a lot.
5:  Got it, and he just said go ahead just go ahead belong to but if you need anything else we taking everything back and I said, okay, I won't ask for anything else. So I go out and I buy another microphone and accessories and I came home and set it up and to Rican I got on Instagram live last night just to kind of test everything out. But for some reason you could only hear one microphone and so we're trying to figure out okay what's going on? And of course is my microphone.  And it's not like we set everything up correctly. It wasn't rocket science and our followers was like we can hear you but your husband seems far away. But when I did some more research, I found out that the Blue Yeti specifically does not recognize two of the same USB microphones and that the only way I would be able to use two microphones for a podcast would be to take back to USB mics which meant both of the blue yetis and by
6:  I mean  I eat like you as a lot of the same tricks every time but I'd feel like I do start with the music like every year. He's like I've never like put these tricks in this order and been like I'll find a song later that doesn't work for me. I always like hear a song and I'm thinking like I'm pretty sure this would work here and maybe I could do something like this here and I really hope this would work out maybe I can maybe I can't and then I'm usually like sometimes I'll just like noodle with the same few songs like just a lot
7:  This week's two times a week, but next week it's going to be back to one and it's gonna be like a solo then guess solo gasps Oh look a stand for a while. And then eventually it will probably be more guests. But yeah, just cause I'm doing the New Direction. I kind of want to have a lot of Education that is not just like what's working best in your podcast and what isn't yeah for sure. Now that makes sense and what are some programs are apps that podcasters should familiarize themselves with like, what do you use to record your podcast?  I actually use zoom which is what we're using to record this right now. It works really well. You can do split tracks. So you're not recording on the same track, which is nice. I also use my project management tool which is click up which is basically just helps me keep track of all the moving Parts because obviously it's not just about recording you have edit you have to write show notes have a good graphics social media content email newsletter all things. So that really helps me keep organized and then another
8:  Something something that holds a lot of people back like I have a couple people that are friends or clients are like I've been wanting to start a podcast but XYZ excuse and I'm like, okay but like you can start and then you get better over time and then people are like wow, that's cool. I mean obviously you can't have like the crappy as audio quality because no one's going to listen. Yeah. No just start start where you can you don't need to splurge and buy the most expensive equipment from the get-go. If you don't if you can't afford it or don't want to afford it. Yeah, that makes sense.  So and then how do you also gauge if you're doing a good job with your podcast like numbers-wise? How do you even gauge metrics for clients? It's tough. I mean, it's really going to depend on your shows Focus, you know, did you know if you're doing a true crime podcast that might be more of a hit than a business podcast. Yeah. The numbers are going to vary depending on the niche of the show. I think podcasting is a super slow burn which is, you know, perfectly fine, but people just need to realize that it's not
9:  People how can I start making a show and I didn't have access to like radio broadcasting equipment or anything so I can't really give radio but then I stumbled upon the world of podcasting and honestly like before starting my own podcast. I had never really listened to a podcast like I didn't even know what podcast work. Yeah. I was looking at like how to interview people some of the pain podcasting. I was like what is a podcast and I'm like, that's exactly what I want to do. So I just basically people how to start a podcast and then like within the next week. I had already started making episodes and ice.  My first oh man, I got to tell you about this. My first few episodes were really rough for all you guys listening. Like everyone is always so worried about how their first episode is going to turn out literally does not matter. Okay, I leave my first like my first four episodes I leave them all up just because of how bad they are. Yeah, just to show that like when you start it's not going to be the best thing ever like it's not gonna be amazing. It's going to be a process like there are Stepping Stones. It's takes time for you to get to a place.
 
Topic 16 causes and prevention of wildfires: 2019 saw a large number of wildfires, in Australia, California, and the Amazon.  What were people saying about them?  What caused them?  How could they be prevented?  I am interested in news reports but also speculation, rumor, and unverified information.
0:  There and Martin caused property destruction death and Pally across parts of Europe and created an electrical failure that affected most of France the worst cyclone in French history brought down transmission lines and caused large swaths of the country to be without power for three days repairing. The lines was a grueling and expensive task and generators had to be brought in from as far as Canada to act as interim power sources economic losses were estimated at over 18 billion euros and the new record for the largest power disruption in history was quickly.  Spurred across the Atlantic from Brazil number 5 Taiwan back out of 1999 the evening of July the 29th 1999 began in Taiwan with the blasting of a warning siren over the city of Taipei. This was followed by loss of electricity across the country causing widespread speculation and rumor as to what could have caused such a nationwide power outage speculation ranged from a Chinese Invasion to a nuclear attack but reality was much more mundane a landslide knocked out pylon cables creating a domino effect.

Back to the left millions of people both literally and figuratively in the dark number 4 1998 Auckland power crisis, Auckland New Zealand found itself without power for a staggering five weeks after the four main cables supplying the city with electricity suffered mechanical damage. The cables were repeatedly heated up and cooled down by auckland's unusual January weather the old and poorly maintained cables eventually failed one after the other forcing the city to use backup diesel generators the noise of several hundred diesel.
2:  You want to know about the Reefer Madness bro? Let me tell you about it. Let me tell you about it rumor has it one of the main reasons that they met we'd illegal after the Mississippi purchase was because California wasn't even a part of the Mississippi purchase. Boom. Bitch. Take it take it accept it in your soul. Look at that is look at the eyes.  Look at them honesty and one rumor has it one of the reasons. Why is it rumors to these are rumors that are in my brain Rumor Has It?
3:  Lightning struck an electrical subsystem in the town of bow arrow which caused a number of circuits to trip and shut down power in parts of São Paulo Rio de Janeiro and many other cities generators that relied on the electrical load of the circuit automatically failed because they were receiving very little voltage and the main power plant couldn't support the load either the chain reaction was caused in part by shoddy infrastructure maintenance as the government was forced to make spending cuts during an economic slump number 6 1999 blackout in France Cyclone low.  There and Martin caused property destruction death and Pally across parts of Europe and created an electrical failure that affected most of France the worst cyclone in French history brought down transmission lines and caused large swaths of the country to be without power for three days repairing.

4:  Interpret the laws of your country and the country is you're collecting in other people are saying oh heck. No, I'm just going to use the data other people are saying no. No, I would never use it. What about you panelists are some Curious people. What do you think for me? I'm always trying to do. What would I do when it happened to me? So it's more ethics question.  Because in my opinion the lawyers I know or like prosecutors. I know besides one or two. They rarely know this field. So to have a good in-depth discussion with them on ethics on how to find it and how to cope with it information only to get that in that discussion started this whole discussion by itself. So I think I trust on the
5:  in that to Pivot the investigations, it's not like we're going to write that password in a report later on the report will only include certain findings stating. Hey, this person has this social media account and this other social media account and as long as it's not used in court and you don't have to reference every single thing you do. I think it's okay to Pivot based on that information again, it's a completely different story if this report that you produce will  Be used in court and you actually have to prove. Where did you get this then again? That's something where you might want to get the legal consultation. Okay. So before the other panelists chime in just real quick the chats going wild. Some people are saying talk to an established that long-term relationship with the trusted lawyer or legal counsel. So you can have that that that discussion with somebody that understands what you're doing what you're trying to do and can it can help you.
6:  It's been too much for people at this point. It's been a week since the shooting but I live in El Paso, Texas. I love El Paso. It's my home. It's where I met my wife. It's where I've gained an entire family. So it's very close to me. And then also a per perspective from Shem who being from Australia that being from Australia. That's one of the arguments that's constantly thrown or out here in the United States when anything like this happens where it's all well Australia took away everybody's guns and everything's hunky-dory down there and that's so that always kind of  Comes up. So I'm really interested to know kind of win one of these things happens. What maybe does it break the news down in Australia, you know, what goes through your head? What are your thoughts on this stuff? Kind of being an outsider? I'm not well, he's the thing. I actually don't want to get to that yet. I want to ask because here's the thing you started off right now just by saying you kind of went on a quick little rant which makes it clear to me that you got pretty strong feelings on it that are still in your
7:  Comes up. So I'm really interested to know kind of win one of these things happens. What maybe does it break the news down in Australia, you know, what goes through your head? What are your thoughts on this stuff? Kind of being an outsider? I'm not well, he's the thing. I actually don't want to get to that yet. I want to ask because here's the thing you started off right now just by saying you kind of went on a quick little rant which makes it clear to me that you got pretty strong feelings on it that are still in your  Chest absolutely, because you were just going to say that we were going to talk about it and then get into it and you went off about you like so it seems to me like the this is what I wanted to ask you why I wanted to ask you on the podcast for most people most General general public of America. There's there are it's getting insane how frequent these mass shootings are and most people probably say something like oh, it's a shame. It's horrible. You see it on the news that goes away within a few days.
8:  There are so many victims that it seems like there must be a villain there must be some person someone we can point to who caused all this pain and in the course of our reporting at Planet Money, we did find villains. We found Ruthless People who lied and cheated and cynically profited at the expense of the less powerful and less informed but those people didn't cause the crisis the crisis was caused by a system and by people who operated within that system people in a camp, I believe Henry is in people.  Ooh, if they had a sin, it was a pretty common one the sin of wanting to get rich they achieved that goal and assisting with inherent conflicts of interest and that system later broke with devastating consequences. For most of the people in this Camp. They also suffered consequences. Although since they were Rich they're suffering wasn't as bad as the suffering of others the hunkered down waited it out and as the economy recovered, so did they and by and large they picked back up in the finance careers that they had before?

So why are meetings such a waste of time? Well Cruise offers two reasons for this phenomenon first meeting participants tend to spend time on on pressing.
7:  All that extra thing which you give to somebody like in the race, if you I if I give you how you go ahead and you start from there you like you give some Advantage I will say Advantage like you or you guys already have an advantage you guys already have this internet thing which is booming like anything. Yes. It was booming at my time as well. But yes, I was late.

9:  All right, perfect. Well, let's move on one other thing that and this one may not even be the best example, but one thing we talked about Fink like the test maker and you know, how do they make things difficult? A lot of times they bore people with the first handful of words when you get to the verbal section, I guess we haven't talked about the structure of a test all that much you're going to do an essay first. Then you're going to do what they call Integrated reasoning for half an hour. Then you're going to do the math section. Then you're going to do the verbal section to miss comes last.  Of benefit a center for at least two and a half hours before you even start to see questions like this. One of the things they like to do you're looking for I want to match up Ireland with this country. And so they made bore you a little bit or Take 5 or 6 words eight or nine words to even get to where you see what you want. So be forewarned here. You may even be thinking Hani the ecology be the same since might not thrown a ton of people off, but they love what we call the curve ball where if you know what you're looking
 
Topic 18 women in stem: I’d like to hear personal stories from women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  I am not interested in initiatives to increase women in STEM, or movements surrounding women in STEM, or news reports about the prevalence of women in STEM.
0:  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so  You know, it's really fun. I can remember the exact feeling / time. I don't know the exact date when you know, my you know, I when I was a kid like I love random things dinosaur space and I wanted to be like, you know an astronaut paleontology store. However, I'd like geeky stuff it maybe that's a common thing. I like is love science and technology because young and excited when I school so I went to La Salle Jebel.
1:  It's crazy because a lot of Filipino startups look up to you as one of the four founders of what it is right then back in 2011 2012. That's where the real startup movement other prior to that. There were a lot of you know here and there there's companies we call it internet companies but it's really solidified when idea space where was born Kickstart was born it is just steamrolled from there and let's just track back a little bit. So right now you're wearing three three main buckets, let's I mean three main  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so
2:  With taking away women's rights with like oppressing so many other people how do we as a community give equal voice to men and women it's tough and I talked about this a lot because I'm an I love technology and I'm a big proponent of it and I think that for the first time we're in an age where we could have a true democracy where we could have an equal vote where we could really hear the voice of the people.  People it's still skewed because of media and news outlets and like you're not getting all the news all the time, but it's coming fast because of situations like Rin now and like, you know, I have a really hard time pinning it on one person in charge when it's a bunch of people that got him there. And so I tend to think like hey, why don't we do a self inventory and really think about why our actions ended up in
3:  Ring one and empowering the other and then pushing one up and one down by the whole feminist. I hate men movement drives me fucking insane because it's like that's not getting you anywhere. Yeah, like not all men are the same. They're just not like just like not all women are the same like certain people do shitty things regardless of who you are and what you know gender you are. So how do you think Society can take that and I mean just thinking like us were in a shit. Oh right now,  With taking away women's rights with like oppressing so many other people how do we as a community give equal voice to men and women it's tough and I talked about this a lot because I'm an I love technology and I'm a big proponent of it and I think that for the first time we're in an age where we could have a true democracy where we could have an equal vote where we could really hear the voice of the people.
4:  On it indefinitely now for at least two decades before the Women's Health Initiative data from large observational trials had suggested that hormone therapy resulted in a reduction in coronary heart disease and mortality now because of inherent biases in the design of observational data, it was necessary to carry out a prospective randomized trial to confirm these findings. The Women's Health Initiative was  is designed to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of post menopausal hormone therapy with the understanding that women would be taking estrogen long-term for the prevention of heart disease not for the treatment of symptoms. However, most women in the u.s. Initiate hormone therapy for the treatment of symptoms not for the prevention of osteoporosis or heart disease now the media attention surrounding the publication of the
5:  Again, more of his story coming out in other words. I'm not talking to any women. I'm not asking any women out because they're probably not going to like me anyway, so I'm not even open my mouth and even let a girl know I'm interested.  So instead you're acting like a woman and insecure shy woman.
6:  Was after a while when you're having sex, he starts to feel good. And I feel like a lot of women who get raped. Sometimes is like they have this weird thing with their people who rape them because sex feels good. It's meant to so for me. It was a weird thing because I decided to date him, so I didn't feel like I got raped.  Man, and I told them that this is pretty common. Actually, we've shared this story with other women and it is more common than you want to even think about and it's so sad but everything you guys are she repressed and she didn't even I was like listen you got rapes and I hate to say it out loud to say that out loud. So you understand that and you feel that in your body and we can accept that that happened and work through it and it healed. Okay. So this is crazy after I said that
7:  But I'm amazed at how one thing such as penis size can potentially make or break a relationship before it even starts.  Again, more of his story coming out in other words. I'm not talking to any women. I'm not asking any women out because they're probably not going to like me anyway, so I'm not even open my mouth and even let a girl know I'm interested.
8:  end of the day because I think everyone gets so super excited about all kinds of ideas that we throw around that one session is never enough to follow. It has got to be a follow-up exactly but I think you know in the middle of the day I could have, you know meetings with people who might come and visit from Industries someone who's interested in the science and the technology that we're developing and and I could have, you know people who might be interested in, you know talking to us.  For purposes of engaging with the community so there could be you know might be media stories or they might be a journal who wants to have a chat a lot of the new science and then the other part is really how we engage with the outside world whether it is community or Industries and it could be just about anybody in the world the last weekend. I was up in San Francisco spend the weekend on the invitation of Google.
9:  Man, and I told them that this is pretty common. Actually, we've shared this story with other women and it is more common than you want to even think about and it's so sad but everything you guys are she repressed and she didn't even I was like listen you got rapes and I hate to say it out loud to say that out loud. So you understand that and you feel that in your body and we can accept that that happened and work through it and it healed. Okay. So this is crazy after I said that  It out loud. And after I realized what was going on with me, literally the inside of my vagina when like and it relaxed and it was the inside was like soft and like I don't know I had christiany. I had never felt that before I was holding all of this tension from that rape inside my vagina and then it relaxed. So this is the power of a Yoni massage. Like I had no idea I experienced this rape and then
 
Topic 19 ai in healthcare: How can artificial intelligence be used to improve healthcare outcomes?  What are some example uses of AI in healthcare?  News reports are relevant, as is speculation from thought leaders in tech and healthcare.
0:  The makers of AI to get in touch with their end users and really create the humbleness around it because it needs the humbleness from both sides. The AI industry cannot stiff-armed Healthcare and Healthcare cannot just rejected because at the stage where it is now, so we think this is very important and ideas also come from I mean 20 years in the industry knowing how and knowing how hard it is.  To drive confidence and Adoption of new technology and AI is it's a hugely and it goes straight into the core of what Radiology does and I mean I saw no, I never saw a technology that just went straight into to production of of of anything in healthcare. So we want to help both sides in creating this
1:  We want to create a place where the human and the Machine can interact and the this this I mean on the results permissions can be discussed by humans and maybe maybe also vice versa. So the concept of you know, when when you're uncertain about the result of a machine, how did with that? How do you order the machine over time? How how do you enable the  The makers of AI to get in touch with their end users and really create the humbleness around it because it needs the humbleness from both sides. The AI industry cannot stiff-armed Healthcare and Healthcare cannot just rejected because at the stage where it is now, so we think this is very important and ideas also come from I mean 20 years in the industry knowing how and knowing how hard it is.
2:  He delivers entire end-to-end Health Technology Solutions that support better outcomes and experiences for their customers at lower cost. So yawns of former Hospital CEO. He's a professor of Pediatrics. He's an expert on digital Innovation. And he's got a huge amount of expertise and data management AI Precision medicine tele-health Advanced Home Care everything you'd kind of need to run something like the medical officer Phillips.  so he's the head spoke to person as well for what Phillips calling a future health index, which is a yearly study which looks at various Healthcare professionals and general populations in 15 different countries and determines how ready they are to address Global health challenges and build sustainable Health Systems and on the podcast we talked about that report was about some of the interesting findings of that report the likes of China Russia Saudi Arabia being almost example as for health
3: What about paper change? Welcome to another episode of the hyper chat. I'm here with Nikita. We have a really special episode. Today. We're going to talk about Oscar health and Hyper change in the healthcare system and why aligning incentives could be make a huge difference for the healthcare industry which in the u.s. Is super bloated and you also have your work for Oscar and you also have a Blog called negotiating the terms about women in VC. So we're going to cover all this startups Tech Healthcare really excited to have you on thanks for coming of course any time.  So, yeah, so maybe we could start before jumping into everything like maybe just give us a little bit of your background and how you got to working at Oscar. Yeah, of course, I basically studied statistics in history. And I think those two combos kind of guided why I got interested in technology so history certainly repeats itself, but you're like, why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? And one of the Pinnacle foundations of how things change is certainly technology? So that's the the History part.
4:  Self-driving car a self-driving car is a robotic car that can drive itself. It doesn't need a human behind the steering wheel switch your rushing to the other side of the bottom of your mouth. But keep making circles around each tooth with your brush self-driving cars use a type of Technology called artificial intelligence or AI for short artificial intelligence. Helps robots learn to be just as smart.  Intelligent as humans AI technology gives machines the ability to think and learn.
5:  Pain, I think in the process and you know that were there to get the pain and then find out what happens in terms of the the tech and there's a lot of aii around. I don't know how well you diligence is being done not on many of them and how deep that AI is at the moment but AI takes that many years to become fruitful and you know really deep and most of it's not there yet, and it's  About having that patient Capital to see that come to life and for investors to do much better due diligence on what AI actually is in healthcare and which ones are worth backing but I think it's going to take a lot of time and we're not there yet, even though there's lots of money going in that direction. So yeah, it's a confusing it's filled with lots of opportunities. There's lots of things, you know, lots of companies around this just
6:  Be made. Yeah and hard work are n but you know, I never forget an entrepreneur. It's definitely a lot harder at their end to get through and what's most concerning is the speed of healthcare sales is extremely slow PC fast. The two of them are not necessarily good bed makes so how that works. How is yet to be discovered but it there's yeah. There's going to be a lot of  Pain, I think in the process and you know that were there to get the pain and then find out what happens in terms of the the tech and there's a lot of aii around. I don't know how well you diligence is being done not on many of them and how deep that AI is at the moment but AI takes that many years to become fruitful and you know really deep and most of it's not there yet, and it's
7:  And started so your working career before going back to college for some time. How has your career been today? What are the things that you've been doing doing that this time? So currently I just started my own consulting company was called to say I so I get a lot of people ask me. Why did you name it to say out so but they are light for license. And so we are a data science and a lot of company and are niches and Healthcare and medical organization. So we want to help organizations to make a better life changing decisions through  Machine learning artificial intelligence and if you probably knew that the healthcare space its laggy little bit compared to other areas. So I wanted to offer our expertise I can have them both. I have you know my past 10 years. I had several group roles and Industry as well as Academia. So I kind of understand the strengths and weaknesses from both sides and I kind of time in between that kind of matches and it's complement both field units offer people the type of help that they want.
8:  Large amounts of data, but they don't have the technical skills the process that so I just thought I needed that space and I wanted to be part of it and it's been my passion ever since then just dig in my old. I've been just the more I read about it the more questions I've become about it and he has just recently I went to in the video conference and even the video this started a whole Healthcare, which was really fascinating. They started a Clairol platform. So it's going to be specialized for hospital so they can offer.  In deep learning platform for hospital. So that's something that I want to be part of as well that resolution kind of bring health care and Hospital bring them up to speed for AI and positions and bring them up to speed great. And why did you say that having kids made you more interested to work in healthcare? I think there's a lot of things I did. You become a more compassionate human being if you probably know when you don't have kids you probably thinking only about yourself and then when your side did you go through the whole process?
9:  Our country now this year we did 15 indeed 15 countries and we send out a survey to a to approximately 2,500 to 3,000 individuals in every country as well as three on the 350 Healthcare Professionals in that country and we tried this year to understand how digitalization is influencing the relation between doctors and patients.  In the office in the hospital and also when the patients are back at home and there are three big messages that came out of the report and there are some differences in the countries, but the three things that that came up very clearly in almost all the countries was first of all that doctors and other Healthcare professionals are increasingly comfortable with digital tools.
 
Topic 20 cost of childcare: I’m looking for personal stories from people that have had to deal with increasing childcare costs.  How did they manage?  What was the effect on their lives?  Reports about average increases in childcare costs are not relevant unless they include quotes from individuals about their experiences.
0:  You realize very quick. It's much easier to keep existing customers happy and increasing this lifetime customer value or at least maintaining the average versus constantly trying to go out and get new clients because advertising it can be expensive and I say expensive. I do want to kind of deviate really quick and do another topic. I'm going to mention this  throughout the podcast this idea of advertising cost and it doesn't always necessarily mean just the cost of
1:  As I'll go back to this keyword tool here. This gives us a general idea of the cost per click for for some of these Search terms and you can see roughly on average. You're probably looking at about a $2 per click cost. What we don't know is the conversion rate of this. So let's say you had a total of let's just say it's two dollars and fifty.  Sense and you were to get 10 clicks. So you spend $25. If one of those 10 clicks to your website converted they became a customer. Is that worth it, you know, so are you can you spend $25 to pick up a can acquire a new customer?
2:  I said there's a million other things I could talk about. But I think I gave some good advice. Hopefully that is basically free. The only thing I'll add.  As I'll go back to this keyword tool here. This gives us a general idea of the cost per click for for some of these Search terms and you can see roughly on average. You're probably looking at about a $2 per click cost. What we don't know is the conversion rate of this. So let's say you had a total of let's just say it's two dollars and fifty.
3: We're here in the middle of the African Savanna on Safari looking for Mike. It's about a lion stalking us. I think it's something much scarier.  It's a search term report and someone has keywords with a hundred fifty percent a cost. Oh, no, never added any negative keywords side. It looks like all their bids are just three dollars no-bid optimization. We're in trouble we need to do something about this giant a cost, but I don't know if we can do it alone. Oh, no, it's the adventure. Should we run? No, no, no.
4:  It's a search term report and someone has keywords with a hundred fifty percent a cost. Oh, no, never added any negative keywords side. It looks like all their bids are just three dollars no-bid optimization. We're in trouble we need to do something about this giant a cost, but I don't know if we can do it alone. Oh, no, it's the adventure. Should we run? No, no, no.  We can save us he'll prove that high a cost to shreds with bit optimization and negative keywords.
5:  Free there is a cost associated with everything. So what lifetime value for customer does it really helps you understand?  Like to what level of efforts it makes sense, so if we take it strictly from a cost expense standpoint if I know that my average new customer I bring in again. This is an average some are going to be more than others. But if I can say, you know what I'm going to spend $20 to attract a new customer to my grooming shop. You might think you know what I'm not really making that much money because I spend let's just say it's $50. I spend $50 to attract and
6:  Purrs, where is a competition within our trainers is like the person who does the best well moment in a month and you submit your while moments and it's documented they go above and beyond I don't care if he takes on out for coffee. You send some ubereats at the hospital because they're sick. I really don't care how you create. Wow moments. Create a wow moment. Okay, and then submit it in them the person who creates the best well moment inside your gym. They get a voucher. So it's like he's a pair of shoes good pair of shoes away every single month to the coach that creates the best while moment might cost you.  Box fill the silence like five. Wow moments going left, right and Center your full coaches 20 while moments a month that's increasing your customer experience. Remember, does it cost five to seven times more to get a new customer? So by giving him 200 bucks a pair of shoes or $150 per hour by met cons or something like that like that's going to increase your customer experience because you coach is going above and beyond now, I think wow moments is something that we can all Implement and really doesn't cost much at all and you're keeping clients for longer. You don't need to get more clients and also if you're creating
7:  Regular bid optimization for a standard product. Maybe the product is under a hundred bucks. Generally. You would look at your Revenue per click and you multiply it by your target a costs. So if you're generating a hundred dollars from a hundred clicks, that would be one dollar Revenue per click every time you get a clicks on average you're generating a dollar revenue. And then what you would do is say hey, I want to 33% a costs. So, you know you would want to  Get your clicks for about 33 cents because if you get 33 cents of cost and one dollar of Revenue, that's a 33% a costs over the long run and then you'd make your updates pretty regularly, you know daily weekly, whatever it might be. However, how would you handle these kinds of situations Steven? I got some good examples for you all ready for this. Okay. Hit me. Let's say you are selling subway tile for kitchens, which is very hot right now a lot of homes that I walk into of subway tile.
8:  We're trying to fit them with what we already know about. And so what I would say is just to remain completely open and curious and respectful and let them tell you their stories. The main point that I wanted to make in this conversation is  I think someone who considers themselves transgender is like fingerprints. Every single experience is an individual experience Note 2 are going to be the same. So you see that individual what's going on with them and what they're looking for in terms of help and support that's a fantastic way to finish because we all are individuals and we just don't go buy a particular.
9:  Box fill the silence like five. Wow moments going left, right and Center your full coaches 20 while moments a month that's increasing your customer experience. Remember, does it cost five to seven times more to get a new customer? So by giving him 200 bucks a pair of shoes or $150 per hour by met cons or something like that like that's going to increase your customer experience because you coach is going above and beyond now, I think wow moments is something that we can all Implement and really doesn't cost much at all and you're keeping clients for longer. You don't need to get more clients and also if you're creating  Well moment, you're creating raving fans. If you create raving fans that like that. I think it's of your business and satisfied customers. Don't refer like Advocates do that. You're giving them moments that they want to talk about on dealing with the girlfriends on a Friday night or they're at work and they're like, oh my gosh. This just happened. Like that's the well moment and they're talking about your business now and that's where it's all at.

You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we  Use that to answer, you know, it would look at it. I mean you by being an individual you're also a member of the community by just being yourself because you have your own experience that you're bringing to America and then that's not quite clear what I'm trying to say. It's pretty much I think what American literature is
1:  Individuality of many people everybody reading it me the song of myself the song of everybody reading it but it's essentially what we kind of talked about and we know we're in relating this back to Henry David Thoreau talking about you know, how to be your individual and how I raised the question of you know, the individual versus Community. I think that question about the individual is kind of Aunt  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective.

Meaning that you can have hundreds thousands millions of well-meaning individuals that feel they are not sick leaving these isolated areas leaving China spreading their sickness to their families during Lunar New Year. Whatever. It is feeling that they are not part of the problem. They're not infected only to realize a couple days later that they have.  A bit of a cough but there's getting a fever they're running a fever and guess what? They've been contagious. Well before that fever well before that cough began.
4:  Five star review. I love those give me stars. Yes, and oh, I did want to say so like I did mention that these aren't like the top top clips, right? These are just all really strong Clips. I really liked so there may be other good moments. But because I played many times. I do also want to say like the last episode last week was a very I think it was a very touching episode with Katie Weller. I just wanted to give a special mention to because because it was the last episode I didn't  Only clips from it because it just happened. But you know Benny mm talks about getting on antidepressants. I think Katie really went there as well and talked about her experience and they both had very different experiences, but I thought that was they're both so honest and so open and I really do think you know, I thought that's a resource that like if I was a teenager, I wish I was podcast existed, you know when I was there, but so I just like really appreciate both of their honesty's and everybody's on
5:  It's working. It's you know, it's finding these host cells as reproducing but thus far it hasn't brought any symptoms nor is it contagious? However, there's a period of time there for some individuals. There's evidence evidence believe this that they are contagious before their symptomatic before the fever for the cough the chills running nose, obviously and the more severe symptoms of pneumonia.

6:  in this 21st century filled with all things hidden on the internet and you know such easy access to our thoughts and feelings and as oversharing a lot of things on the web, which honestly I don't mind I love I love all of this that's happening on the internet, especially right now that I really been very picky with what I follow but I feel like it also makes as so much  less vulnerable
7:  That's all it takes.  in this 21st century filled with all things hidden on the internet and you know such easy access to our thoughts and feelings and as oversharing a lot of things on the web, which honestly I don't mind I love I love all of this that's happening on the internet, especially right now that I really been very picky with what I follow but I feel like it also makes as so much
8:  I don't think it's our default for most people, you know, but that doesn't mean there's not value in it just because we as a society have devalued something does not mean that it holds no value. I agree well, and then there's that whole thing of like our current structure is garbage and I can go on so many pots and feeling and so on my guess is why I think we haven't done the which podcast yet because I think it's going to be very biased opinions.  I have so many fucking thoughts and feelings about the structures in place, but it never hit that we're here for today. Right? This is not the content you signed up for. Okay. So, um, I know something we really wanted to bring to the attention before we get into any type of homework is as you're as you're feeling into things if this is like where you want to head
9:  Give them this I feel like one last chance, maybe not even a chance a way to find your common ground to explain all things to yourself and to them because I feel like chats like this open so many.  Parts of our brains in ways of thinking and all the boxes. We put some thoughts and feelings into and close them and forgot about and that when you have this chat that is very honest and deep and real and very emotional you really learn so much about yourself as well. I want to how you're handling things like this on what you forgotten about on how you feeling how to express. It just be very raw and real and honest with it. Obviously if you can handle saying it
 
Topic 22 chernobyl hbo: The series Chernobyl aired on HBO in 2019.  What were people saying about it in podcasts?  I am especially interested in discussions about how events depicted in the show differed from reality.
0:  I'm unique in this office. I have a much longer commute than most people For Better or Worse most times worse. So I listen to a lot of podcast namely right now. I'm listening to One called critical role. It's a podcast about Dungeons and Dragons. We're a bunch of voice actors play it I listen to a design podcast weekly called 99% visible a comedy podcast called my brother my brother and me. I mean the list goes on and on and on but that's just kind of The Stereotype box that I'm trying to check.  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.
1:  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.  Always I'm catching up with season three. That's a really great one. Oh there I mean there's some episodes of the Conan podcast that like have me in tears. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, honestly. Yeah, I don't I don't think that's kind of there. Is this there is this one episode of Thomas middleditch and Schwartz that like killed me and then film spottings kind of a go-to that was like the first podcast I ever started listening to regularly. So awesome. Well, it's read more about Patrick and Kyle's trend of podcast as digital test Labs as well as our other.
2:  As I positive that this person wrote this thing as well have to Google it. Yeah, but I think it was very sluggish and so hit him hit him real quick. So the lake house by Kate Martin what Alice Forgot by LeAnn Moriarty and  Oh my work on where the cotton dancing by Dahlia? Yeah Owens so good and I would say that Brooke is definitely more interested in listening to like I don't want a slower-paced books, but I will because I think that's the way I would describe them. Okay, as someone who's kind of stumbled in on you listening to them like more character-driven she wrote big little lies. I knew it which is the HBO show with all those people famous women. They're definitely more character-driven.
3:  Oh my work on where the cotton dancing by Dahlia? Yeah Owens so good and I would say that Brooke is definitely more interested in listening to like I don't want a slower-paced books, but I will because I think that's the way I would describe them. Okay, as someone who's kind of stumbled in on you listening to them like more character-driven she wrote big little lies. I knew it which is the HBO show with all those people famous women. They're definitely more character-driven.  And like they're all female protagonist, right? Yes. And so if you enjoy that type of thing those three books would be good for you. Yeah. All right, go on the other hand myself. I only complete I confess I live legit and on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I love listening to Fantasy and science fiction books and just like the sort of these epic sagas. Yeah, and once again, I have walked in on and like the area
4:  Disney plus that's not going to theaters that's going Disney plus. Oh, no, so they're already saying, you know, we see you were raising you. Okay, there's going to be more of that and I think DC is saying okay, we've got you got your lady in the Tramp that if you look at the filmmakers that want to do HBO. That's a great. You know, HBO HBO is Sopranos, right? Yeah Sopranos Guardian just can't think of any other HBO shows because we went  Pano's Guardians of the Galaxy I make a mean Game of Thrones. That's why I was trying to get out Sopranos Guardians. Get how about girls sex in the city looks like some City Asher rounds. That's why I said Gabriel. That's why I try to get a bargain. I mean, come on I'm saying is that what six feet under that is true? Yeah at The Leftovers baby. I see you with his makes great television. Great films. They do they do great work. Yeah. I know a lot of but high-profile filmmakers like working with them so that
5:  I like that. I think the one thing we just got human mind is this is in May so we have a lot of money right for DC Universe to make some announcements about how hey maybe we're merging or we're going to give you a credit like you're going to have HBO Max for this much time. So I it is really confusing right now, but we are a few months out. I keep thinking that this is coming out the same time as Disney plus Apple, it's all that but it's really it's in May right? I think that was a smart move on their part to push it. It is smart, especially because this next piece of news is that  that HBO Max is expected to produce major DCU films. So we're talking huge films here Mike as our Green Lantern in his room. I'm curious. Do you feel like what this is talking about with major films that we are going to launch characters in the DC Universe app or HBO Max app like Green Lantern and then have films also on the HBO Max or do you think that we're talking about characters that have nothing to do with HBO Max and just developing.
6:  Don't you you don't want to spend a hundred fifty million dollars to make but it's HBO's answer to a Netflix film. We definitely and not only Netflix film. But when you think about it and is Marvel doing that, they're not let me finish. I'm just adding a attending question, sir. Just put yourself to water in your mouth. I do like it a lot. That's me. I'm Wonder Woman coming through right now. That's team. Thank you Ryan with Disney plus putting lady in the Tramp on.  Disney plus that's not going to theaters that's going Disney plus. Oh, no, so they're already saying, you know, we see you were raising you. Okay, there's going to be more of that and I think DC is saying okay, we've got you got your lady in the Tramp that if you look at the filmmakers that want to do HBO. That's a great. You know, HBO HBO is Sopranos, right? Yeah Sopranos Guardian just can't think of any other HBO shows because we went
7:  Since it came out it was a best-selling Series. So there was a lot of people who are optioning it for movies TV shows. I think there's a lot of stuff that's been in the works. I think but famously in the last 10 years in 2009 director stack Snyder of the 300 Fame developed that that the Watchman into a movie and this was kind of a lukewarm movie didn't do great at the bottom box office did okay, but it was also very polarizing reaction from the  fans of the series and it's also spawned I think the movie spawned video games and there's also a motion series that was part of it but diving into the TV to adaptation from HBO. So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the

So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the  Creator and showrunner for lost which was one of my favorite shows. I remember racing home when I was in high school to go and see like what happened. I'm lost except to like the later Seasons when it kind of died off and he's been a showrunner and kind of a person in in the industry for a while and the series being developed by him. It's been likened to like a reboot of the series but not really it's like also like a 34 years in the future, so it's not dealing
9:  Inside dealings of Game of Thrones and HBO at all. I have seen something going around online. Do I believe it? Not necessarily but that the pilot and the story that was being set set out to be told might have been somewhat problematic again. The I don't want this to turn any near close to fact. This is just a summer. I saw a thread of someone it's on  And the way the children of the forest were mostly, you know depicted as the the people of color performers and actors and then it was became this weird. They were maybe trying to tell a story which is maybe a valuable story to tell of of the the Andals and the conquerors and the old the old gods and the new coming on over and maybe taking over this land from the people that were already here. Again, that's not that that's a story that has some value.
 
Topic 23 notre dame fire: The 2019 fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris personally affected many people around the world.  I’m looking for episodes of podcasts with people talking about how it affected them, how they felt about it, their personal recollections of visiting Notre Dame or otherwise experiencing Notre Dame in some way.  Factual information about the fire or about the cleaning and reconstruction effort are not relevant.
0:  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.  It was the most magical music and the people who would walk by in the morning would often stop for a moment or two to listen to The Sounds rising out of the Old Stone building not many people noticed. But if you listen closely, you would actually hear more than just the choir singing inside. There is also another noise that rose out of Notre Dame. It was a beautiful sound as well full of humming.
1:  It was a crisp cool morning in the beautiful city of Paris people sip their hot coffees and nibbled on their freshly baked baguettes in the cafes. They walked along narrow roads and over beautiful stone Bridges going to work or simply enjoying the city.  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.
2:  It was the most magical music and the people who would walk by in the morning would often stop for a moment or two to listen to The Sounds rising out of the Old Stone building not many people noticed. But if you listen closely, you would actually hear more than just the choir singing inside. There is also another noise that rose out of Notre Dame. It was a beautiful sound as well full of humming.  And cooing Wings this wonderful noise belonged to The Talented pigeon choir of Notre Dame. They called themselves limit which means the crumbs in French. Let me 'it was famous among pigeons all over France for their amazing birdie music once a day the small choir would all fly to the top of the cathedral and line up in a straight line, then they would clear their throats by cooing.
3:  Although I mean a lot of people a lot of big games are being played well before January 1st, let's the load centers a couple of years a couple years ago. Now that I know people that's not a major six New Year's with but that was a good one. That was a to Primetime programs in a historic ball in the only way this is prime time is if it's Texas. Yes, and it's not the feel not that they're the best opponent Norton could play no but among the four candidates, I guess it although maybe they are I don't know Oklahoma State I think is challenging.  Yeah, but I think Texas is The Only Name that makes people think hey, let's tune and ESPN leading into the playoffs the Texas Notre Dame would be pretty happy about it as well. That's true. But yeah that because the lack of recognition of bullet is going to be disappointment. I knew and I both said watching Stanford, this is a Citrus Bowl quality Team Notre Dame Notre Dame Notre Dame. They are at least that they're deserve better than the camping Bowl this one time Candy World Bowl, but they're not going to probably get it. I don't know. I think they would
4: Live I know that there's not much chance of them getting the playoffs but I just did a thing this morning about this would be five years of the last six heading into know which Brian Kelly has remained as had one loss or less going into November. So there's some significance of that guys. What are your thoughts on the line moving the way did well we thought the four and a half was Askew one-and-a-half made sense. And I want one by Notre Dame would have made sense to I you know, this usually late money is dumb.  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.
5:  Yeah, but I think Texas is The Only Name that makes people think hey, let's tune and ESPN leading into the playoffs the Texas Notre Dame would be pretty happy about it as well. That's true. But yeah that because the lack of recognition of bullet is going to be disappointment. I knew and I both said watching Stanford, this is a Citrus Bowl quality Team Notre Dame Notre Dame Notre Dame. They are at least that they're deserve better than the camping Bowl this one time Candy World Bowl, but they're not going to probably get it. I don't know. I think they would  What do you think you deserve to your six? I think nobody could win two years six ball depending on the opponent, but they're at least a Citrus Bowl level team is kind of how we're looking at it at that moment there and I actually meant to go and I will do this at some point maybe put on our message board are there are ten and two teams that don't get into your sixth a bowl now. I don't know what snorting going to be the only one this year. I that that maybe that's not true. No, not at all. I mean I'm power among power five conference has oh, but that it but it's happened before.
6:  And and your theory is to that he was very unhappy because he was playing poorly everybody hated him. So he wanted to leave and I don't blame him. Where do you think that all came from the I think when people some people told you this past weekend and book is I hear him because not going to come back. I think that's old information from when they heard it at the beginning of November unless he thinks he's played well enough against Boston College and navy and Virginia Tech to go pro. It is a hard.  Exit Korean book is that I can think of no other way of saying this it's a hard exit frame book did not come back to Notre Dame and it is a terrible exit for him book or his legacy at Notre Dame and for how he's going to be treated next year.
7:  C glow about them. Yeah, it's just a bad football team the whole I guess I can't stress enough the people that the bottom half the SEC sucks. And if that's all tournament, it's the bottom half of the other P5 conferences. They'd get skunked. Yeah. Well, I mean the whole SEC narrative is ridiculous. I saw SportsCenter guy after Notre Dame was just blown out by Georgia man. That was such an ass kicking. Oh what a minute Notre Dame was driving to win that thing in lost by 6 that if you didn't take Notre Dame in the points on that, you know,  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the
8:  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.  She can being favored by one and a half two and a half something like that like sort of less than a field goal or right? Right, but nobody make favors is surprised because I think the great Timber a former Clemson SSID Notre Dame graduate said tweeted out that the last eight night games in the series. The home team is eight. No, I mean that would sort of lead you to believe that Michigan should be sort of a slight favorite in this game, but I think the better I don't buy that again.
9:  Line stood on the edge of her house and took a deep breath. She couldn't believe this was it. She was about to fly to the Notre Dame and try out for Lim yet judges. She puffed her feathers and jumped off spreading her wings and turning in the direction of the Notre Dame Madeline looked down at the winding streets of Paris as she flew and felt excited and nervous all at the same time. This was it this was the day she'd been waiting for for so long  She had spent so much time practicing so much time dreaming. What would it feel like to finally sing for the judges at Lem yet? Would she be good enough? Would they choose her? She had been practicing for so long finally as she was thinking of these things. She saw Notre Dame in the distant as she got closer. She saw that all the pigeons were entering inside the building through a little hole in the top of the

So first and foremost, we have the economics piece then what are your what are your initial thoughts that you  Of when you think of the economics well, and I encourage everyone to really dive into the Austrian economics here because as you know, as as Colin was asking me it's like how did I get into the economic side of it? Well, I got into it because I was trying to argue with people and I realized that I didn't have the knowledge. I didn't understand inflationary versus deflationary and and that's really a small piece of this. Once you start getting deep into this I think has lit in bastiat, but Henry has what's the one who wrote?

Well while this is a peaceful protest three days later police were firing tear gas and rubber bullets on the 15th of June the Hong Kong leader care.  I made a dramatic reversal and promised to indefinitely delay. The extradition Bill protest was with throwing bricks and petrol bombs back at police. And this is causing a massive issue in the city the next day 2 million were on the streets calling for the complete removal of the bill and Caroline's resignation many Saw hers beijing's puppet slowly cutting Hong Kong's freedoms in passing power to mainland China. So I heard some rumors about the Chinese government instigating fights and what moat can you clear that up?
8:  And I'm far from doing that. I'm reading news. I'm going through updates every single day. I'm trying to make myself as much rational as possible so that I'm not putting any wrong views in front. You need to understand that it's okay. We cannot do something on a large scale. It is not important to every time go out on the streets and show our faces for doing something we can do things behind the curtains.  And that we can do is spreading awareness. We can create more rational citizens in our country and which is the best solution to whatever is happening today. We need to understand that the weapon of protest right now is knowledge. We need to be as much knowledgeable on this topic as possible right now now.
9:  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi  I was ordered to Lottie what was ordered to encourage that he charged now a lot of you might also say that Delhi police did it it's nothing about our government our leader or our prime minister. Let me tell you how the leap on this works then leap police is not under anybody's control except the home minister of our country. Not even the state government.
 
Topic 25 black lives matter: What do people mean when they say “black lives matter”?  I am interested in personal reflections that give context to the phrase “black lives matter” and why it is important to individuals.  News stores about Black Lives Matter protests are relevant as well.
0:  A slave to their disproportionate recording contract that favors the record label a label most likely owned by white businessmen one could also be a slave to materialism using jewelry as a superficial validation of their ego and self worth a consumer mentality that doesn't disrupt the real Power Balance in America here on forward and within the context of Tyler's personal story. It seems Tyler's contrasting the chains of slaves and is jewelry to point out the irony of his success. He's written enough wraps to get a chain.  And now use them as feeding into the same Halo materialism that has left him feeling dissatisfied and as I'm questioning his motives and life in general Tyler continues. How many slaves can it be till Nat Turner arise? How many rides can there be tell them black lives matter here? We have another contrast of old and new as he references Nat Turner leader of a 19th century slave rebellion, and the black lives matter the 21st century movement concerned with ending racial and systemic Injustice around the world just like
1:  And now use them as feeding into the same Halo materialism that has left him feeling dissatisfied and as I'm questioning his motives and life in general Tyler continues. How many slaves can it be till Nat Turner arise? How many rides can there be tell them black lives matter here? We have another contrast of old and new as he references Nat Turner leader of a 19th century slave rebellion, and the black lives matter the 21st century movement concerned with ending racial and systemic Injustice around the world just like  Verse 1 Tyler's stream of Consciousness Begins by focusing on a personal confliction, but he quickly wins his lens to consider how his personal conflict fits within larger societal and historical constructs or issues in verse 1 Tyler question how much stuff you could buy until he's had enough and makes it change here. Tyler questions how much Injustice the black community can tolerate how many rallies are riots must there be until there's change as verse 2 continues. We'll see how Tyler weaves both of these questions together.
2:  And that's what I swim in building off the black lives matter line. Tyler references the shooting of young black men by police. He raps pew pew the n-word Life a game of basketball. He better shoot that N word because if that cop got Trigger he better pull with his reference to basketball. Tyler plays up The Stereotype that all black men are athletic as these types of generalizations of a race that often lead to unjust acts most relevant to this verse on forward. We think of the  unfortunate assumption made by some that black men are criminals inherently dangerous or threatening. It's these kinds of assumptions that led to the killings of black youth that sparked the black lives matter movement just referenced simultaneously Tyler Compares trigger-happy cops and their proclivity to shoot their guns to a basketball players proclivity to shoot a basketball as the verse continues Tyler shows how he uses his wealth and material Goods to escape these stereotypes wrapping his when I get pulled over I usually play it cool because
3:  - game of basketball you gotta shoot that nigga cuz if that cop by truly better.  And that's what I swim in building off the black lives matter line. Tyler references the shooting of young black men by police. He raps pew pew the n-word Life a game of basketball. He better shoot that N word because if that cop got Trigger he better pull with his reference to basketball. Tyler plays up The Stereotype that all black men are athletic as these types of generalizations of a race that often lead to unjust acts most relevant to this verse on forward. We think of the

These are all because of white people and then aren't you saw Sandra Bland we saw because he's fucking white supremacist. And that's what they are. That's all they are. These are mad white supremacist because black lives do not matter we can hashtag it we can we can write we can storm Tottenham for Mark Duggan black lives. Do not fucking matter.  And that is why watching something like when they see us, so why do people educate yourselves educate yourself do better? Because when you know better you're going to do better. Also, I want even if you keep making care.
5:  Exist, you know all this other stuff. This is the one video that got you go. Oh my God, Mike Brown's Body on the street for four hours. We saw the rights and also all these protesters in Ferguson or did yeah, it's black voters service that guy that was killed with the asthma Eric something. Oh and it colder send the cigarettes.

You have to heal from your trauma unapologetically whatever you have to do within reason that doesn't harm other people because in the same breath, we do have certain things in life that we have to do. No matter if it's hard or easy, especially when it comes to our children, you know, and to put ourselves aside and not be selfish. So I'm not saying this in a super extreme way, but I'm
8:  You know and it's interesting, you know, we live in a so-called Christian Nation that will change the Bible's, you know statements and and um, but will hold fast to you know, document written hundreds of years ago by some old white dudes. They don't have a context of what we're living in now, but you know plenty of people say like once when Sandy Hook happened nothing else matters once it was okay to mow down white kids that we know.  A else is safe. Like there's this country does they cares more about this this constitution this old Constitution that's not certain aspects of it is not relevant to what we're dealing with today, but that's more sacred than the lives of children and human beings today so that couple with the rhetoric from 45 like this is a you know, this is the situation that we find ourselves in now okay ray.

4:  To the motivation and intent of the defendants three others involved in the Watergate operation were not identified during the trial when they could have been by those testifying.  For almost a year Woodward and Bernstein had written countless words on the Watergate scandal each article chipping away at the seemingly impenetrable wall of Lies surrounding the White House Woodward was proud of the work he and his partner had done but he was well aware that it hadn't changed anything. But from the moment McCord's letter was read before the court. It was like a dam had burst open.

They knew there was more to uncover Woodward and Bernstein used several informants including bookkeeper Judy ho back but none became as famous as they're very
7:  Making 49 states and over 60% of the vote in the aftermath some of Nixon's AIDS privately joked that the Watergate scandal was to thank for Nixon's win. The Democrats had spent the last few months of the campaign fixated on an issue that according to the results Americans simply didn't care about  Has Nixon began his second term Woodward and Bernstein found themselves in a rut after all of their reporting on the Watergate story Americans had chosen to stick with Nixon while their work had played a critical role in the arrests of G Gordon Liddy and Howard hunt.

Topic 27 civil rights protest stories: I’d like to hear stories about protests and protestors in the Civil Rights movement in the US in the 1960s.  Stories about individual experiences with protests; individuals’ motivations for protesting; how protests like the March on Washington came to be; the roots and foundations of the movement; etc; are all relevant.
0:  Of a new activist movement and as Rosa listen to Edgar's pitch she felt Hope Spring in her chest. She was about to spark the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott.  Up next we'll hear how roses work transformed the Civil Rights Movement now back to the story.
1:  Racial equality but roses activism extended Beyond bus protests and active member of the NAACP Rosa championed black victims of sexual assault organized acts of Civil Disobedience and founded educational initiatives for disadvantaged students of color.  Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley on February 4 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama, her early life was unstable as her parents separated when Rosa was only two roses birthplace in Tuskegee insured. She grew up in the center of the nascent Civil Rights Movement prominent black intellectual Booker T. Washington was active there as soon as Rosa was old enough to understand issues of race.
2:  Ice had to park cast.com merch for more information our audio biographies cover big lives, but we like to focus on little known facts today. We're discussing Rosa Parks dubbed the mother of the Civil Rights Movement. She's most famous today for refusing to give up a seat on a bus in Montgomery Alabama her act of resistance against racist segregation launched a boycott that proved pivotal to the fight for  Racial equality but roses activism extended Beyond bus protests and active member of the NAACP Rosa championed black victims of sexual assault organized acts of Civil Disobedience and founded educational initiatives for disadvantaged students of color.
3:  That was tough. Yeah, I feel like the museum just has so much to offer, you know day and then there's the basement. Yeah, that's really started. Yeah, you didn't even like get amazing back. The basements is the most intriguing part because you go down and then like you go wait, like I think you go two floors down and while you're going up you're getting the history from like the start of slavery until like the Civil Rights Movement. So they gave you like they show you.  The boats they show you the places where they got shipped off. They tell you all the stories. They tell and like Emmett Till. I'm like everything like I know about Emmett Till because I searched for but I know a lot of people in the Netherlands, I don't know about NFL and that's kind of like a really big he was like that was like kind of the trigger point for the Civil Rights Movement like that kind of stuff doesn't get in a week. We don't get learned and landings like it's not really our history.
4:  To like be more conscious about the environment like where do you even begin like top three things to do definitely educate yourself? Yeah, because a big issue is like people don't know how to defend themselves. And I think that's how you like Lou you kind of lose run of yourself while you're doing it in the first place so educate yourself but not to the point but not to your breaking point where you're like, I can't decide the only thing I can think about and it's really causing you anxiety. Like I'm at my point now where I know all the information I'm not going to read anything in. Yeah, we're about it because I already know and then secondly is  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.
5:  Like a positive outcome for a bad situation something like that. Yeah, I think that 99% of people would agree that social media informs so many people but one argument that I would make and when challenge I would make is that you see real life activism like, you know in the streets like marches in that you've seen that on the decline lately since the Advent of social media. Do you think that there's a temptation to say look I've already  I posted this on my story. I posted it on my Snapchat. Like look I'm done. I've already supported the movement versus the real life sort of canvassing the protesting that actually makes the difference.
6:  Up next we'll hear how roses work transformed the Civil Rights Movement now back to the story.  The black community in Montgomery, Alabama was outraged following Rosa Parks arrest on December 1st 1955. The NAACP wanted to capitalize on roses case raising awareness as they tried to overturn Montgomery's segregation laws. They decided the best way to fight back would be to boycott the Montgomery city buses on December 5th the day of roses trial n-double-a-cp volunteers.
7:  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.  The other day they like load of young people like took it over. I'm like it gives me so much hope because he'd be talking to your parents or things like that and they just like well like, you know, we've done this like we've lived half way through our lives, you know, like but seeing those sort of people gives me so much hope so finally like what gives you hope to carry on and like what gives you the drive to keep going with your work? I think I'm gonna like battle a little today, but I think the younger Generations are way more intelligent and compassionate.
8:  What are you trying to do? I don't understand what is wrong with this country right now firstly an illiterate leader is getting into the getting into the hostels in universities. I don't even know if he has ever seen those universities for his own benefit. This is something really stupid.  What now talking about these students protest a lot of morons would even say that wider students have to go and protest when they go to study in the universities. These students are not protesting for the purpose of violence. They are protesting for the purpose of spreading awareness.
9:  Those were not students and this has been confirmed by the police itself Delhi police arrested 10 students for violence and out of or tends to saying that those were 10 students, but when it was found out those were not the students but some locals who were judge who got involved in this protest and the middle for their benefit.  I'm not saying that protest might not go wrong. They might but it doesn't mean that we have to stop protesting.

3:  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a  Start to you know to sad introduction to diet culture. But as you're telling me I'm thinking this is like so many people that I see this is an I felt so alone at this point. I remember sitting on the couch going what is wrong with me? Why is if no one's talking about it. I believed that it didn't exist that there was some fundamental floor. Everyone else have willpower. I didn't and I blamed myself for a long time by the time I'm 17. I'm deeply unhappy. I'm deeply disappointed.
4:  This is where am I eating? Disorder was kind of, you know going full strength and it's you know, I reach the goal. Even when I go to my goal weight though. It wasn't as though I ever felt good enough. I always look to myself. Oh, you know, I could still lose weight and everyone around me thought yeah, you know, you could still lose weight and yet I was in a really Slim body or still not good enough. As soon as I stopped seeing this dietitian. I fell into binge eating so, you know, I knew everything I needed to do yet my body took control.  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a
5:  I'm you know on my trust in my body on so many different levels. So yeah, so that was that was that I had this diagnosis this label of PCOS. That's who I was it meant that I was, you know fat but it meant that it was going to be difficult for me to lose weight and kind of the yo-yo dieting continued because they just said well, we'll put you on the pill that will regulate your Cycles which we really know that actually going on. The pill doesn't really do anything to your Cycles, but  But that was my treatments told me to lose weight if I went and that was it. So there ya go to guy yo-yo dieting continued as I was trying to lose the weight, but then putting it back on and then losing it put it back on and then it was I carried on with that. I went finish my school went to you needed the unique thing got a job and then it was when I was working my first kind of proper job in London that this horrific incident.
6:  Changing the environment creating some mindfulness and and figuring out some workable new behaviors, but then if it's one of those sort of off the cuff, hey, I just want to have the donut you just enjoy yourself. That's it. You go for gold. Enjoy Lindy. I got one more question when it comes to the how to's and I think this is one that's probably relevant for almost everyone. So Liz asks, how do you consistently stay healthy control your eating and portion?  Sizes and not diet but lose some stubborn fat. She says a healthy lifestyle is what I want. Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?

With yourself. I was now nutrition and I wasn't eating that obviously led to me getting Cravings because when the body can sense that you are lacking in a main macronutrient or nutrients, it will send signals of hunger to tell you to keep eating until it's actually received but it's after this podcast is not meant to diagnose treat prevent or cure any medical or mental health condition.

Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?  Great question and I think you're right. This does talk to what we were saying before. Okay, so I'm just going to give you some more healthy habits to give you some ideas or some little ways to just improve your health and it may have been qu8 in losing weight. So we know we talked about not having alcohol during the week. So that is one option. Another option is to increase your steps for the day, you know, some people find that have been a step cut counter can be controlling other people don't so just find if you're one of those people that you
9:  Their first diet and to think of that number going lower is like heartbreaking to me because when we think about I've been on diets for the last 15 years and we think that that might increase we know the damage that's been done from the yo-yo diets to to your metabolism. We did an entire episode on that and how those crash diets are damaging your metabolism and always had before as podcast. We were exposed to that whenever we were in our 20s, right, you know did some damage so  ISM thankfully been able to recover and most people will be able to recover but what about if we start that yo-yo dieting at the age of 12 my God, I mean, what is that doing to a growing metabolism to a person that is constantly going through changes that are affecting their body and then we put a yo-yo diet right on top of it. It seems to me that is it's just it's unbelievable and it's I can't even believe we're having this conversation.
 
Topic 29 racism in canada: How does racism appear in Canada?  I’m looking for personal anecdotes about peoples’ experiences with racism in Canada.  Research such as sociological research is relevant if reported on.
0:  Is the difference is he Embraces his conditioning and uses it for political purposes. So I call that a vowed racism and to the best of my ability. I am committed to challenging my racist conditioning and the reason why it's important for me to distinguish to make that difference clear is I don't think it's useful for me to position Trump as racist and me is not racing because that invokes what I think is probably the most  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula.

1:  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and  Early intentional or if it is intentional. We're not going to admit to that right? So this this adaptation to make a racist really bad and you know, everybody else is good has made it virtually impossible to talk to the average white person about their racist conditions, right? And I think it's the root of all white defensiveness and I think that's what's happening when barbecue Becky is being told what you're doing is racist nice people and I'm sure she sees herself as a nice person can't all
2:  Think Hmm and even just like one city over like Montreal gets worst Winters than we do. They get awful snow and cold Calgary to cover its really bad Winters and then obviously we have like all the way up North to the like Arctic. Yep, totally different the territories. Yeah, Canada is vast but mean we don't have any like deserts. That's true. Yeah the Prairies I guess we were actually talking about this. I mean, I'm sure there's lots of countries where this is true I mean, Mexico  Anywhere else, but somewhere like u.s. You know, if we want to move somewhere warm that's still in our country. Like we can't do that. But if you are from like the northern Us New York or something, you can move to Texas, Florida California or even just a different part of California and have different weather, but we appear in Canada. We all got the seasons. Okay, live t coming in hot with the questions. I don't know the exact answer.
3:  Across the very very special special ones who actually really really are interested in the sociological questions and in the epistemological challenges, and we've just started working on an ESL C funded project, which is trying to look we're not trying to it will look at how semantic web Technologies can be used for sociological research. So we're actually going to test drive some of the semantic web Technologies to look at in particular the relationship between social class aging and health over the life course, and so we've chosen deliberately really difficult social Concepts.  Is that sociologists themselves can't agree about the try and see what happens then if you try and describe those in semantic web terms, what are the challenges? What are the difficulties where do the differences between sociological thinking and computational thinking appear? What are the controversies? What are difficulties how do we transform them? So some of that's about the sensibilities and beliefs of the people and some of it is about how those are embedded in the artifact or the tools of the
4:  Anywhere else, but somewhere like u.s. You know, if we want to move somewhere warm that's still in our country. Like we can't do that. But if you are from like the northern Us New York or something, you can move to Texas, Florida California or even just a different part of California and have different weather, but we appear in Canada. We all got the seasons. Okay, live t coming in hot with the questions. I don't know the exact answer.  What is the demographic ethnicity of Toronto, I guess so yeah, I don't know the exact numbers on that but I would say it's very diverse. I'm pretty sure we are one of the most diverse countries in the entire world. I think it's safe to thank to say and assume that you could find probably someone from almost every single nationality and religion somewhere in Toronto. Yeah, it's actually so it's so great. It's so good. I think it makes us all way more interesting and respectful.
5:  Absolutely amazing, and it does cost a little bit but I think that's such a great part of life and experiencing life is a good old meal.  Okay. Next up is Emily's question. And they say do you consider Toronto to be the New York city of Canada? Yeah. Yeah, if I had to say people often say that Vancouver is the LA of Canada, which is another major city in Canada. Uh-huh. I think on a very surface level comparison for sure. I think it's one of the big cities in Canada one of the two or three major cities in Canada. Yeah Montreal is obviously really big to I guess if you're looking at like
6:  Okay. Next up is Emily's question. And they say do you consider Toronto to be the New York city of Canada? Yeah. Yeah, if I had to say people often say that Vancouver is the LA of Canada, which is another major city in Canada. Uh-huh. I think on a very surface level comparison for sure. I think it's one of the big cities in Canada one of the two or three major cities in Canada. Yeah Montreal is obviously really big to I guess if you're looking at like  A lot of business goes down in New York. You have a lot of the large financial institutions our base there. You have a lot of headquarters of companies based in New York, then. Yeah, we're similar in that sense where I think a lot of our companies their headquarters are going to be in New York. I mean Toronto as well as maybe Vancouver and maybe Montreal those are like your three options when I go to New York. I find it to be a very similar experience to life here in Toronto. You can kind of expect and find a lot of the same types of things and the city is kind of
7:  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.  So another another piece of evidence that white people often give is our minority status in another axis of social life. Right? And so the question that I would offer a white person who experiences oppression is somewhere else is what does racism look like in your community what a in particular anti-blackness look like in your community. What does anti-blackness look like?
8:  of laid out in a similar way like it's a quite a similar experience in my mind except for New York is way bigger. Okay, I will say something though. I've never been to Chicago. Have you been to Chicago? No, I want to go so badly, but I've heard from most people that Toronto like although we might be the New York of Canada. Well, we're actually really similar to is Chicago based on like size and population like our population to Chicago's actually very similar like 2.7 million versus the population of New York is something like  Eight point six million so we might be a little bit more in line with Chicago. But yeah Toronto's big city in all of Canada and New York is a big city and all of the USA. Okay. Next question is where should people visit that isn't very well known. Are there any hidden gems weight in Toronto or in Canada? I'm gonna assume they're speaking about Toronto. I can't even talk to all of Canada. I've only been to a couple other cities. I know you guys need to tell me the hidden gems in Canada.
9:  She said don't get she said Miss move it all that. Oh, my best friend is black. So she's saying that she don't want to hear that. Wow shots fired shots fired stated that you're interested in solving this problem and ending racism in your view if the system of racism white supremacy is ended what benefits  people experience

I will I guess pivot the direction of things as and when needed  so the interviews or what I would like to refer to them as chats because I do not like the idea of me just sitting there and dictating the conversation.

5:  Earlier this year. I realized that the amount of women that were actually interested in sharing their stories would far outweigh the amount of events that I would have in the space that I had available and not only that I didn't think it was fair that these stories were only being shared to 20 or 30 women that were coming along to these events. So that's kind of put me in a position where I'm a determined as hell to grow the events, but also be wanted to create another platform where I could share this story.  It's not just the women that were coming along to the events. But to anyone in the whole wide world who was interested in hearing the stories of entrepreneurial women who are based in New Zealand, and eventually it'll be further afield but for now, I feel like there is hundreds of stories over here that I want to share.

Like we're going to get into a big conversation about like body positivity through your body connectivity as a better word through motherhood the transition of into motherhood because that's like something I'm so fucking passionate about and that's like work I'ma blow your goddamn minds, but give yourself time. Give yourself time be gentle go slow be interested.  Curious. Yes be curious and get it with yourself before you bring in another human. Yep, right like we didn't really get it with yourself before you bring in another human in. This was my approach this time as well where I was very mindful in because I experienced prolapse this time around which is a whole new whole new fucking Terrain in the pussy department where I

Topic 32 giants game december 22: I want to hear about the NY-Washington NFL football game played on December 22, 2019.  Why was the game important?  What were people saying leading up to it?  What was the outcome?  How did it affect the NFL postseason?
0:  There's a this game has been passed along from some important people years and years ago, you know it at the turn of the century 1906. There was a question on whether to let this game continue. It was the rules need to be changed and we're going through a little bit of that nowadays. I couldn't to be a good segue. But yeah, but it and  number of colleges there was no pro football back down or a colleges were saying we're not playing that game anymore. They were there was some some problems many deaths injury that's one and ironically people look this up the man some what made the difference to kind of change and got got to gone was Believe It or Not Theodore Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt decided this was he loved the game of football. So in 1906, he gathered together a group of
1:  Name his rotation in his minutes and a snap counts were down a little bit. So he felt a lot better this week. So that's a good sign. And another thing, you know, the forest Buckner, you know, he's he's been on the on these bad night. Our team's he's seen what happens in Seattle. He had enough of it last year versus Seahawks at home and he put his stamp all over that game the December 16th game last year in San Francisco in the Niners pulled out the win. He sounded very much the same after the Rams game.  Mmmmmm speaking about the Seahawks like it did last year bunker knows how the importance of this game and I think Buckner is going to put his stamp on this game this week and you know, finally hopefully get this streak over in Seattle. Yeah, you know, I real quick. I want to touch on something that it was pointed out to me that Marshawn Lynch coming back for the for the Seahawks. I believe it was two weeks ago when we were in Santa Clara for the Falcons game Marshawn Lynch.
2:  It will get on so let's get right into it. So there's a lot of things talk about the draft will get the calamari little later. I know a lot of you want to hear about that. But first we want to talk about just the the philosophy of the draft itself is an interesting topic to talk about and since the NFL has sort of shifted in a different direction in terms of its high flying its passing heavy league and that's what that's what fans want to see it, but I want to see it's exciting. How do you think that that trait that changes the philosophy? How do you think that changes the NFL the team's the  On the draft itself. Well, I think it's made all the difference in the world. I'll tell you personally I guess the back in the day. They used to draft himself some guard some running back some linebackers and you got everything you got star from the ground up. You gotta start from the you gotta start from the ground and everything builds off of that. That's obviously very outdated these days only thing that matters in the passing game and since only that matters is the passing game what everyone's treating as the most important when using the draft Capital pasta,
3:  Red River rivalry Red River rivalry Red River rivalry, I'm killing it bro killing. Are you got it? You got it. Well, since you're killing it I'ma let you go ahead and pick a I'm let you pick this up you always on the Texas game on now, come on now. Yeah, you know what? This is a fun game arguably a me in my opinion. I think this game has the most potential be the most fun to watch actually this week. I think when you come to Big Twelve matchups, especially Big 12 rivalries, I think that this game will be a high-scoring game. I think it could be very entertaining.  I think if you look at the seniors, I think they're gonna have a lot of adversity to deal with for the first time and I think Texas will play them a very good football game. Obviously. The Sooners offense has been exploding you got Jalen Hurd some Lincoln Riley leading the way they did some incredible things to this point haven't really played anybody that special obviously up to this point a lot of people been saying that at this point the season because you know going back to what we talked about before with scheduling. There's been some teams that haven't really scheduled tough opponents to their first five games, but obviously each year your team will route
4:  Yeah, it was that was the most incredible part. And the other thing I want to say about this game that I remember is everyone say DMACC was good. And I remember wanting him in prison because Brandon Marshall took his lunch all game long and they almost lost the game because of it. Yeah, this this defense was completely fucking deplorable people people might want to sugarcoat it you got the Sports Talk. Josè of the world saying that, you know Brady's never carried a defense to a  To a Super Bowl anything that's complete bullshit. The 2011 pads defense was an absolute joke. It was an absolute joke week one on they needed to Kyle Arrington interception to you know, basically seal this game, which is indefensible. Right a quarterback throws for 500 plus yards. You should win the fucking football game and somehow the outcome at the end was still not quite in doubt, but kind of in doubt, you know, and yeah, this was just
5:  On this Premier League head of coaching course last December December 2018 first and foremost again. I don't know the specifics. I don't know him as a person. I don't know the Dynamics. I don't want to talk from anything. But first and foremost, you obviously have to say to be in this sort of hot water being head of coaching knowing how diverse football is and how inclusive it is and especially Crystal Palace. Like I don't really know south of the River South London. I'm going north boy, but isn't that crazy?  Raiden Fulton, he find them sighs. They're very diverse and Multicultural backgrounds. So it displaying ignorance again, if he did make this comment whoever he did whoever it was I sympathize with the victim and whatnot, but it preaches ignorance and in a club like football, I mean a club like Crystal Palace that is a very close close ties to the community just a Premier League club in 20 in the 21st century or just in 2019 really almost in 2020. This isn't what you want to hear now again, I don't want to
6:  Hopefully Texas can get the rematch that they want the big 12 championship game and hopefully this time around the Longhorns can return the favor and it's so weird. You know, I'm so used to having bragging rights all year long based off who wins the game at the Cotton Bowl now. It's a little bit different. And now the Big 12 Championship is more important than this game coming up this weekend. So as much as I would love to have this one hell you'd love to have both if you're a fan of either team. I would prefer to lose this one and find a way to win the game up.  Jerry World in early December ya can't blame us for being too biased for both gonna now go ahead and pick against the horn people know I'm pessimistic. So they're always mad at me. I think they're not used to being mad at you and they were hoping you'd be the Saving Grace of this podcast. Right? And I think you know, even though this is a not as probably not as good of an Oklahoma offenses those last two years even despite the numbers saying it is right now and even with the offensive line issues, there's still some too many holes. I feel like and how Texas plays
7:  I think if you look at the seniors, I think they're gonna have a lot of adversity to deal with for the first time and I think Texas will play them a very good football game. Obviously. The Sooners offense has been exploding you got Jalen Hurd some Lincoln Riley leading the way they did some incredible things to this point haven't really played anybody that special obviously up to this point a lot of people been saying that at this point the season because you know going back to what we talked about before with scheduling. There's been some teams that haven't really scheduled tough opponents to their first five games, but obviously each year your team will route  Reach This crucial Point like Oklahoma has now they play a pretty good team and you're going to see what they're made of and I think Texas is going to push Oklahoma a little bit in this game and you know more than that. I think I Linger on the o is going to keep control the clock like they've done all year. I think they're really good at that. I think, you know with a few empty drives though that they might come up with I think Oklahoma is going to start press and hurts my good under pressure from that longhorn defensive front. I'll be back and forth throughout the whole game, but I think in the fourth quarter, I think Oklahoma is just going to turn it on I
8:  he's got good brain that talk about Tom Brady that's why I like in the first hour you heard me like backing off of betting on the Titans it's like I don't know of mad because it's so hard to go against everything inside you that says this is the Patriots this is still Tom Brady this is no Bill Belichick in this is still the playoffs but Mike Vrabel willing to do anything whatever it takes to win that's an intriguing game this week yeah there's that side of then there's a side like that your eyes see all year long like this offense it stinks it's not  News came out yesterday the to ah Tong of Allah. That's right. Yeah right there to atone. Villa will make his announcement on whether he's going back to Alabama or going to the NFL on January 6th. Just a year ago. People were saying that the Alabama football team could beat an NFL team because of how good to a was as a quarterback. People are saying that now those people obviously we all know
9:  But what you saw from Travis Homer last week is not going to cut it in pass protection when you're trying to help Russell out there. So the defensive line needs to get after it this week. This is what you get paid for. This is why you go and draft a Nick bow. So now if the for was playing I feel even better about it just because the Ford has that first quickstep and he would be able to I think handles fetty pretty well off the right side and I think the rotation help them out a lot last week to you stalk. You spoke not you spoke, but they spoke to Nick Bosa after the  Name his rotation in his minutes and a snap counts were down a little bit. So he felt a lot better this week. So that's a good sign. And another thing, you know, the forest Buckner, you know, he's he's been on the on these bad night. Our team's he's seen what happens in Seattle. He had enough of it last year versus Seahawks at home and he put his stamp all over that game the December 16th game last year in San Francisco in the Niners pulled out the win. He sounded very much the same after the Rams game.
 
Topic 33 hvac industry environmentalism: What is the HVAC industry doing to promote sustainability and “green” technology?  Has it been effective?  What is the effect on people working in the industry?
0:  Things in a day because they're so busy putting out fires. They don't understand the tax laws her amazing right now and how to really I'm not saying don't pay your taxes, but there are certain things you could do to pay less taxes, you know, this is fun for me. But yeah there I just went on and on about you ask me a simple question. It's me. Yeah. There's you were in the Atlanta Market here. I saw one of your trucks. Are you guys still here you guys move out?  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but
1:  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but  So the deal is he came in so my new operation super excited about it. He always look I get a lot of Consulting from a lot of people. Some of them are friends of them charge me. Some of them just come from books some of them podcast, but he came in flew into town wanted to hang out show them my place showed him. My plan showed him. My pll's my balance sheet and he said hey you're losing. It wasn't $150,000 in these four markets. He goes. Can I just take a guess on what's going on?
2:  Say how do we use less?  How do we in to operate these things? How do we use technology to make us more effective and efficient? How do we then switch off our Reliance obsession with carbon? So after things that fall out of it, but that they're the conversations that can be had because once decisions are made.
3:  How do we in to operate these things? How do we use technology to make us more effective and efficient? How do we then switch off our Reliance obsession with carbon? So after things that fall out of it, but that they're the conversations that can be had because once decisions are made.  We already have technology in place that can help us solve it. Yeah, but we know that in building infrastructure takes a long time. Yeah, no definitely so decisions that we take today won't be realized for 20 years potentially. Yeah, so and then just flipping to the last batch of question. So obviously my podcast is called sustainable with a question mark. The first question is do you think that we are able to say in our current existence?
4:  Before they leave us so that they're not, you know fumbling through, you know, the very basic functions of how to be HVAC technician, you know, so, you know, I think that the new technology that's out there all these digital types of gauges and some of the newer bluetooth-enabled think like that. I think it's fantastic for technician that knows how to use a basic set of gauges. Yeah, go ahead and at one point at some point in your career, you know,  Stan those digital gauges because the digital gauges themselves don't make you the super technician, you know, if you don't know how to take your Ricans on a standard manifold set of gauges and understand what those readings mean to you. It doesn't matter how much you spend on a set of gauges. It's still not going to get you anywhere exactly. That's really what my ideas were, you know, you know some of the some of the I've seen electricians nevermind HVAC technicians and not the knocking electrician or an HVAC technician eyes.
5:  I'm out. It's been a blast. Happy HVAC.
6:  Getting yourself to a position where you're becoming the most effective version of you. Like I said, this is what this podcast is all about and over the next coming days weeks. Hopefully even years of success of with this podcast. I'm going to be sharing those tips tricks and hacks. I'm also going to be bringing people on to the podcast that are being effective at the highest level, whether that's some of the most effective Fitness coaches in the industry, whether that's effective business people whether that's some of my own clients or people. I know that have a crazy amazing incredible transformations.  I'm going to be bringing them to this podcast. So you can hear stories from other people that if you don't buy it from me, if you don't get it from me that you can be motivated and make a change. Maybe the you're going to get that from someone else. So on the next few episodes, I'm going to be interviewing. Like I said some of the best in the industry and the fitness industry getting them to share with us what's allowed them to become a fitness executive themself? Because it was only yesterday. I was listening to someone else's podcast where a multi-millionaire I'm talking. This guy's net worth was a hundred and
7:  You want but it's the field experience when shit hits the fan. That's when you really start to learn when when you're by yourself and there's nobody there to help you and you struggle and you you bleed and sometimes you cry because I'm sure there's a lot of HVAC texts have been stuck on jobs that have shed tears. That's when you start to learn and in my opinion.  It's out of frustration. It really is. Yeah, because you got to do something to get that system running or whatever it is. Yeah, I have to agree on that dinner. So so the episode the topic of the episode is you wanted to discuss some of the older tools and and just how text should should come into the industry. Just kind of knowing how to use these tools of whether the older or newer or whatever. So maybe you can get into what your thoughts were on that.
8:  Graham recently and you're doing some some pretty cool stuff by kind of showing some of the history of the trades and I saw your post about the older tools and the older trucks and I think that's really awesome. It's so if you want to just like shout out your Instagram profile name and kind of what you're doing and how you came up with the idea to do that kind of stuff. That would be cool.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, you know and on Instagram, it's HVAC chronicler. So basically can check me out there. You know, I came up with the idea. I did start it. Actually December the first week of December this last in a little last past year and had some great response so far in a lot of support by some of the bigger guys that are out there including yourself HVAC or refer guy a few others.
9:  Into our life like seven years later and have the opportunity to open up a Paul Mitchell school and and to be able to be more involved with with the company.

So my Mom Mary Louise she was sued in a hairdresser since she was 14 years old in Washington DC. She went to We Now call career and Tech but back then was called a Vo-Tech.  How to cut hair and and like a lot of women of her generation in the 1960s when it became time to raise a family she stepped away from her job. My dad was the primary Breadwinner of the family and and she did hair on the side that was howl our family always had fun money. I like to say, you know, I'm right cutting hair but I never thought I'd be a hairdresser. I went to college for computer science and physics and got out of college and was working in the computer industry. And when we all went to college the deal was my dad would sell his engineering business.

Well to me, there's so little occasions or you can show up somewhere like basically naked that's every Friday and Saturday every girl does not have fries. I what he's talking about there. So few occasions where you could be like fully naked like not folder make it like one of those and maybe for you, but I think  Levine is one of them where it's acceptable to show up in like basically lingerie. Okay bunny ears. I'll give you that. It's a little more acceptable on Halloween, but it's also not that much like a basic Friday night is not much better than like Halloween, you know what I mean? Like what I wear on a Friday night is not more slutty than I would wear on Halloween probably think so. Well, I also don't dress up like that. I feel like bunny ears would make anything sexier but you could also wear bunny ears to any like themed party like the jungle party.
3:  That's beautiful. It's amazing and it's amazing that you say that you know, I grew up in a way where like my parents always try to make it seem like they were perfect to me. They didn't want me to see the breakdown I said, hey guys, I mean I did see them all the time but they didn't want me to see them. They would try so hard to hide that for tonight. No fighting. No. No, I can't say I didn't see that definitely saw that but it was just that they will kind of make it seem like oh like you didn't see anything. That was nothing though.  You know and it's and that's the thing like even with this with podcast. I want my parents to be listening to these interviews and hearing stories from people who they don't come in contact with on the day, right? And you know, that's just one example of who I want to hear this. I want everybody to hear this because I want everyone to hear your story because I want them to see themselves in your story and if they don't see themselves in your story, I want them to see how they can relate to someone who has come from a completely different life. And even if they can't relate to it, at least they can leave when you knowledge. So there's always something to take away from our sure so,

And even if they can't relate to it, at least they can leave when you knowledge. So there's always something to take away from our sure so,  Well, I guess what I wanted to you know, the last point I wanted to talk about was actually what I thought I'd start off with. So it's amazing this this it's come full circle. It's gone full circle, but joy is your only job tell us about that. So if you're talking about the book, I changed the name of the book title. Oh, okay, it's not so it's not Joy is your only job anymore. I just made that decision recently. So it's actually flip the script.

And if you just obtaining information with a shitload of blockages was the point of the information. What's the point? What was the point of you digging for that in piece of information, you know, if you don't understand it now when you have blockages  And you seek information you're basically looking for information that's going to justify your fixated perspective on your personal reality and people need to understand that, you know, it's right here and there and then that you have to like acknowledge like, you know, you have to ask yourself. Am I looking for information? That is the universal truth or am I looking for information that's going to justify.
7:  And you seek information you're basically looking for information that's going to justify your fixated perspective on your personal reality and people need to understand that, you know, it's right here and there and then that you have to like acknowledge like, you know, you have to ask yourself.

And and I love what you were talking about with the clicking this piece of it because that is exactly what happens. And what's worse is that when it's the higher up that is behavior like that. Then that really starts make a very toxic work environment.  Tracked so I mean the best thing to do is try to get that person in and hear their side of the story see what's going on. And then that because that person knows that there would be no ostracized. Mhm. Oh, yeah, they totally feel it won't even come you know, so they're being bullied a little bit here and there and they're kind of on their own and they can't wonder if they see a mid-level or somebody.

Topic 36 cryptocurrency risks: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies?  Many people are talking about cryptocurrency as an investment and it seems to have many benefits.  Are there any drawbacks?  What are they?  What setbacks have people suffered when investing in cryptocurrencies?
0:  So there it is the fundamentals of crypto. We've learned what it is what problems in might solve and how people around the world are using it. Now remember it's still quite volatile, but nevertheless what if you're interested in buying it for yourself or looking at it as an investment, you'll have, you know, six months in a row of Bitcoin up every month and it feels like a risk free trade. It's easy right just happens every month you make money and then people start getting greedy. That's alright Paul managing partner blocked our capital a hedge fund focused on investing.  In cryptocurrencies will be talking to him in the next episode and will be learning the investment side of crypto.
1:  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait  Wait lists go through some complex. Use I that's tailored to a traitor not till like an ordinary consumer. And the worst part about it is you can't just buy cryptocurrency with a credit card or US Dollars. You have to actually bring cryptocurrency from somewhere else used it to get cryptocurrency. Well, this is way too much to ask for an ordinary person to get through.
2:  Ryan if we remember the definition, that means they can't pay their debt. So they can't redeem tethers for an equal amount of US Dollars the authors argue that there's a risk already associated with crypto currency exchanges. So exchanges are places where users can trade different cryptocurrencies people can also usually buy crypto currencies such as Bitcoin by depositing a fiat currency the authors argue that multiple strong relationships with different banks will help keep them solvent.  Third risk is if tether limited's Bank freezes, the reserve assets the author's claim that the banks are fully aware of tether limited's business activities with cryptocurrencies and believes that the company is in full compliance 1/4 risk is if tether limited runs off with the reserve funds, okay. So the authors argue that everything is transparent including the owners location and information. So any theft of funds would be easily traceable. The final risk is the centralization risk of pinning.
3:  Hey guys, it's great to be here.  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait
4:  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.  That gives you the credentials to sell cryptocurrency and a wallet is really just that grip that the private key. Okay, but I buy that you send it to me at five cryptocurrencies is the five top market caps. So like unicorny 3000 top 100. Yeah, that's okay. So you get top 100. I bought five you send me it and there's 50 bucks on there. We have packages of different packages. Okay. Now I got the key. Yes. Okay. Now what do I do with it? Great. So we have clients who?
5:  People doing bad things. It's all of the other people too. But you're kind of seeing all the same people that made mobile work. You're saying all the same people that made social networking work. You're seeing all the same people that made the internet work or early PCS work. So yes, there are some people here that are doing some bad things but there are a lot of other people here too. Now that we have a good understanding of Bitcoin. What about some of the other cryptocurrencies out there? And actually what's the difference between a cryptocurrency and a crypto asset crypto assets is sort of the more  odd term because there are certain types of crypto assets which are not necessarily currencies because one of the properties that you need of a currency is that it's fungible right like a dollar is a dollar and so Bitcoin is effectively a Bitcoin and they're interchangeable. Whereas for something like a Pokemon go card, you might have two different types of Pokémon cards. And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between
6:  Your authors recognized with the proof of Reserve solution is not completely trust list and decentralized. The main bottleneck is that tether limited has complete control over the reserve asset. The first risk is if Ted limited goes bankrupt in such a case the author's state that the u.s. Dollars would still be redeemable. Another risk is of tether limited becomes insolvent.  Ryan if we remember the definition, that means they can't pay their debt. So they can't redeem tethers for an equal amount of US Dollars the authors argue that there's a risk already associated with crypto currency exchanges. So exchanges are places where users can trade different cryptocurrencies people can also usually buy crypto currencies such as Bitcoin by depositing a fiat currency the authors argue that multiple strong relationships with different banks will help keep them solvent.
7:  We acquire five cryptocurrencies for you out of the top 100 by market cap. We secure them using military-grade encryption on this device. This is a c block.  And it is the starter kit To Join the cryptocurrency Revolution. So we launched a pilot and in 30 days. We generated sales of more than thirty thousand dollars. We had International interests shipping to customers in eight countries on five continents. And so we're doing a seed round to launch our product in Canada.
8:  Survive in such a bad economy. And one of the ways I survived is with cryptocurrencies with such bad inflation. It'd be crazy to keep his wealth entirely in believe ours. So in that case you're using your bolivars to purchase Bitcoin and then holding Bitcoin instead of the Bolivar. A lot of people are doing that. But because of my work I don't actually earn in local currency. I write and I get paid in Bitcoin or in cryptocurrency simply.  Because of thanks to our currency controls. I cannot have bank accounts in in dollars is simply not legally Can Only Hold local currency. So cryptocurrencies are away from me to bypass all of these restrictions and actually get paid for my work and can you give us can you share? What is your daily routine look like when you're you know shopping for food or paying expenses or paying rent. How does that work for you? So in that a lot of people accept Bitcoin directly, so
9:  And it is the starter kit To Join the cryptocurrency Revolution. So we launched a pilot and in 30 days. We generated sales of more than thirty thousand dollars. We had International interests shipping to customers in eight countries on five continents. And so we're doing a seed round to launch our product in Canada.  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.

And like you know, how did that how did you feel after that popped off? Um, well weird thing about that was I wrote that one. I was like that was home when I was 18 still living like my parents house every sound in that in that song like even that you hear like now, those are all still GarageBand stock drums and like I think the feelings that might be  Different is the piano but like the bass is all just like I'm pretty sure the base on that is like the fake like fret base in GarageBand. Like it's really just it's really it was weird because like I had that song for a long time and it came out when I was still living in Indiana. I was living there for like even like two years after it came out. So I was like not out here that much aside from just like just writing like it was like I'd be out here like two months at a time and it was kind of weird because I was like out here.
6:  He traveled with friends. I think once or twice at least internationally. So one thing I notice is that and with sorry with that being said, I've traveled like a few times with my family. So when I know when I travel with my friends, I notice everything that I've picked up from traveling with my family is translated when I travel with my friends the the point where it's like, well I'm a parent like when you travel because it's probably the most efficiently  I believe yeah, you know Seiko it works for them will work for me. But then they're just those types are like, oh my God my dad. Does this they could carry your passport that finding everything ya ready reading everything like in line while in Immigration before you get to the counter? Yeah. Everyone should do that. Don't be the guy who's like writing it and he won't let you go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah little and I guess you're more responsible when you're with friends as compared to when you hear a bit more.
7:  Reading just The Superficial because you all have experienced this where it's like that's not really it, right. Yeah, of course with the with the other people if you're abroad you're like, I don't know how they really do things. So they're probably doing it. Like my the first thing that comes in my head. Yeah. Yeah, if you have the privilege to do it, it's been one of my most enjoyable like it's the most enjoyable experiences of my life like traveling very very thankful to be able to travel all over for sure. Yeah, and so thanks to my parents.  Sponsoring the most child more Shadows the folks. Yeah, before we continue this episode of no one's home.

So I guess we can start by like talking with you. Mark says, you're the most recently traveled. What do you think we get from like going to other places? Well,  Some of the simple steps like the weather. Yeah, it's nice for sure sharing liking you could take it for granted. But like when you go to a colder place or where it snows you just see a whole different part of the world. It just functions differently the different challenges like, you know, it doesn't rain over there like it does here right earlier today was pouring right? It just don't have that typhoon type whether yeah, so that's one. I mean in terms of culture and sites most of the countries that I get to go to. I mean we try to pick him. Well so usually
 
Topic 38 workplace diversity: What are things companies are doing and could do to promote diversity in the workplace?  Things like workplace programs, initiatives, education, and outreach are relevant.  Discussion about the outcomes of these efforts are relevant as well.
0:  have talked about some of the experiences that they've had in their workplace and see if you can identify them in your own workplace and see if there are ways that you can start to help your workplace address them and for people who maybe do not identify as heterosexual also sort of do a self-assessment and think about some of the different topics we discussed see if you feel like those are common themes maybe in your workplace or in your experience and kind of see maybe  See how being queer or identifying as something that's not heterosexual affects your mental health if at all, it might not and you might be totally out and proud and maybe only positively affects your mental health, but if it doesn't sort of like start to self assassin check in with yourself and pay attention to the ways that your workplace or people you're interacting with maybe heightened some negative mental health symptoms for you and start thinking about ways that you can sort of make your brain feel better.
1:  Person in this room. I am going to handle the street homework for the week. I think the straight homework for this week. Your homework is to I think start like assessing your environment. We talk a lot about self assessment with respect to mental health and I think as a straight person this is not your area of internal. Well, I mean, I mean you do need to reflect internally as well, but I think for purposes of this podcast think about some of the things that Lauren  have talked about some of the experiences that they've had in their workplace and see if you can identify them in your own workplace and see if there are ways that you can start to help your workplace address them and for people who maybe do not identify as heterosexual also sort of do a self-assessment and think about some of the different topics we discussed see if you feel like those are common themes maybe in your workplace or in your experience and kind of see maybe
2:  City it's kind of like saying we will only accept lesbians, you know into our business like we will only focus on helping dyslexics will let me help focus on lesbians. I'm not saying anyone's ever done that but it's kind of the same concept. It's like you're picking one stream as opposed to understanding how the neuro-diverse brain works how the what we call the right side has or the right brain works and looking at how you helped that group because  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how
3:  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how  Supported as a whole but we're not quite there. So what can you do in the meantime? So one of the one of the things that popped up in the group was around meetings and around if you're stuck in a meeting for an hour and a half and if you're in any business that has more than 10 15 20 employees meetings still seem to be at the Forefront of what companies think they're about, you know, you get stuck in those board tables and and usually someone who's got a left brain talks really slowly with it.
4:  So today we're going to talk about the way that queer people are affected both in the workplace and not in the workplace by different experience they have by virtue of being queer or rather just non-heterosexual and how that affects their mental health. So this is going to be episode one of a two-part series here for our lgbtq plus specific episode in this first episode. We're going to talk more about our experiences.  As gay people in the workplace different things we've encountered and our jobs sort of a few negative experiences as you maybe can expect some statistics and then in our second episode we're going to talk about the ways that we can better support these people because they are for sure in your populations. Even if you don't know it and both the way that you as a colleague or a friend or a family member can support them as well as how your workplace can better support them.
5:  I think that really improves my mental health I go to these events and he leave them and I feel so much better to have an environment work environment where you do feel included and where you do fo you have a voice and you can speak for yourself and be yourself. I think that can really help your mental health. Yeah, I agree. I'm glad you mentioned that I know I just talked about the ways it negatively affects me, but I'll talk about the positive side to I think like you said, you know, like without Darkness. There's no light kind of thing. Like I think the like the dearth kind.  Dove gay people in the workplace and some of the isolation that I felt before now where I work. I was delighted to find like several gays in the workplace who were very out and proud and my supervisor calls my friend and I there his to gay daughters and we're all this like happy dysfunctional family, but it's super cute and it's it's so it's so nice. It's like so welcoming and I can talk about Whatever Whenever with whoever which
6:  Another Community member or like somebody who I could relate to in that way the idea of it and the idea is like a diverse A diversity of people being in the workplace that I think would have been helpful and it for sure didn't help any like mental health symptoms I had how was your experience? Yeah. I think your point about isolation feeling isolated. I think that is something that I really identify with because when you don't have other people who  See you or our show right away that they're willing to accept who you are. Then you do either self isolate or you have to it becomes a chore to then push yourself to show them to come out to them as we were talking about and because of that you don't really know who you can talk to you about personal struggles that you might have in your relationship struggles your because often has to be said it making friends when your adult is hard and often the easiest friends to make other ones you work with but if those people
7:  All because of how they're acting. You don't feel quite comfortable being fully authentic with them and you don't have that outlet. You don't have those Self Care Partners at your workplace. You can only get so close. Yeah, you can only get so close today and there's always that division of like, oh, well, I can talk about all this other stuff, but I can't talk about my partner. I think the pressure to conform can affect anyone who doesn't fully conform to this.  You know toxic idea of what a heterosexual or masculine person should be or what a heterosexual feminine person should be yeah, that's very definitely then. I think you brought up some really good points about the ways that different companies and firms will be will have diversity committees and talk about inclusivity. Do you want to talk about the difference between us? So I think there's been a big push lately especially because clients want it and there was a reason to have them
8:  Ourselves becomes, you know exhausting or taxing but like as it directly relates to mental health, I feel like that feeling of like isolation always really affected by mental health. Like it would be it would always be like kind of like a comorbidity Factor like something else would already be making me like anxious or maybe I will be having a bad day at work and then sort of feeling like really isolated and like I couldn't help that I would need like a gay person to talk to about that but just sort of having like  Another Community member or like somebody who I could relate to in that way the idea of it and the idea is like a diverse A diversity of people being in the workplace that I think would have been helpful and it for sure didn't help any like mental health symptoms I had how was your experience? Yeah. I think your point about isolation feeling isolated. I think that is something that I really identify with because when you don't have other people who
9:  Okay. So one of the things we get talked about a lot in our group and around is around the workplace when you're in work environments and things aren't always going well and we kind of look at the companies working for and we say hey these guys say they're inclusive but they're not actually inclusive. It's a pretty common theme and what I kind of relate it to is is kind of the LGBT movement, you know.  The neuro-diverse movement for ADHD. Dyslexia Etc is kind of back where they were in the 80s 90s where it was kind of starting to and I'm presuming that that I'm guessing those years but a kind of the point where they were starting to get recognized understood discrimination was lowering and understanding was increasing neuro diversity is really at the cusp of this point and we're seeing you know, we're seeing business.
 
Topic 39 social media marketing: I’m looking for tips and suggestions for creating a social media marketing strategy.  What kinds of things do I need to think about?  How can I reach the most people online?  Are there companies that can help?
0:  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and
1:  Before you take somebody on to help you with your social media. It's just one example, but get that it's I always think it's like you wouldn't get in a car without having a map or knowing where you're going. So it's just get that strategy right invest in that and then you'll be off and flying and it will make such a difference to your income and your business. Yeah, and I agree. Like I think marketing is probably the biggest area that people struggle with that and mindset but they don't realize the mindset is actually impacting them the way it is, but with marketing I  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.
2:  X I was telling people anything except for a tech startup which we all know better than to say that because that's where I ended up. So yeah that the full Journey I'm working at it. Now. I'm working to Tech startup that is in the film world. So there you go started with the CPA firm in Kansas all the way to this. Yeah. It's quit the quite the journey. I don't know. That's all you wanted to know. But yeah your listeners to know that I'm not full of crap.  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.
3:  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.  Has long been debated in our survey found that those social media is key to a marketing strategy 19 percent of marketers are still uncertain as to how to measure its Effectiveness. Right and a part of me thinks that there will always be an element of uncertainty to social media dark social as they call it. It's honestly nearly impossible to truly measure and Report the impact that brand awareness from social media has on the bottom line, but think about the trillions of private messages shares comments likes views and so much more that happened every single day.
4:  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.  She and I think that's important because if the only thing you're doing is focusing on the medium, which is video. It won't work for you. Like it's not going to deliver what you're hoping. It's going to deliver at some point. It's going to feel an authentic here audience. It's going to kind of fall flat in terms of measurable. Like hey this actually increase their bottom line. I hope to stay home or whatever like whatever you're hoping video will do it will not if you're putting all of your weight just on the medium.
5:  With like issue think when was the last time you watch TV? We don't read earlier. We used to watch TV a lot. But now we stopped watching TV only maybe for some news we watch but otherwise we see all our TV shows online these days and maybe this is the reason why Netflix Amazon Prime and all those platforms are growing like anything now since all the audience move to online.  So all these companies are also going online because that's where our customers are. And this is the only reason why didn't the market is growing like anything and it is one of the best career option while because it's a very new thing and use this almost every company they need to go digital if they want to grow. So then we're in a market like if you know digital marketing there are companies who will ask you for help and you can help them. Maybe you can join them all so you can
6:  On social media, but it really hasn't come to fruition yet. So we'll see how that plays out this year. Yes, we will.  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.
7:  And to say there's when you're trying to be an influencer or work with the brand, I think you have to look at it as a business relationship and understand that there are things need to mesh up and there's some things that you need to be aware of just like the brand needs to be aware of so that everybody could make an effective relationship. Absolutely. I really as a business owner small business owner myself when I launched my marketing company, I had no idea that I would evolve into  Your marketing. So at this point social media is quite literally the absolute basic thing that I do for my clients influencer marketing is where it's at whether it's a client that decides they just want product placed with influencers that are already on my list and people that I follow that I know are genuine or there, you know ongoing clients for whom I do social media when I'm running things like affiliate programs I have to vet
8:  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and  Jion money into the specific elements. That would be a kind of top tip for me as get right first thing. That's so important as I think that's the thing. It's like everybody like a headless chicken. Yeah, and I think that's a big is that we try to do all the things and then when you try and do everything it just is a total mess and disaster and you wonder why you're not getting anywhere near side. Yeah. They also monitor obviously. So once you have decided once you've got your strategy in place and you've committed
9:  Engagement and traffic but I think that engagement or just a good overall indicator of quality of that. Yeah, cool. Yeah. The last data point I wanted to share is that the vast majority of marketers 85% use third-party tools like buffer to support the social media marketing tools can help you to streamline your workflows help you to save time and even ensure your content reaches the Right audience as the right at the right time absolutely tools are arguably more important than ever with the amount of outgoing and incoming volume brands are  These days so lots of brands are using social media as a customer service tool as well as for amplification and just a little bit more about the 1800 marketers that took our survey 49 percent of the people who took our survey work at companies with fewer than 10 full-time staff a further 20.5% work at companies with between 11 to 50 full-time members and about twenty three percent of marketers work at companies with over a hundred employees. And in terms of marketing team size the majority of respondents in our survey.
 
Topic 40 bees dying: There have been numerous news reports of bees and other pollinators dying. I want to learn what I can do personally to help bees and other pollinators. General discussions about habitat loss are not relevant.
0: Hey everyone, welcome back to be on the talk of podcast formed in conjunction with Ted xuf and independently organized Ted event determined to dive deeper into the talks that you know, and love I'm Erica and I Virginia back in Action second episode of the podcast is season. We are very very excited because today is our very first interview. We put it into perspective. We're going to talk about the be in business recent years. You probably have heard a lot about saving the bees and the dying bee population is seen a lot of increased press according to the be informed. Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.
1: Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey.

So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying.

We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.  Beats, so obviously we should care about them a little bit, right? Yeah, no definitely super important and you have actually plays a very big role in this because they are the world's leading entomology Department according to the Center for World university rankings. And in tandem with funding from the state just spilled a four million dollar honey. Bee lab dedicated to the next generation of be research. So after gonna be he's no that's that's the that's the be in business. So here today. We have our first interview Robert Schulte. Robert is a third year here at University of Florida.
2:  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.
3:  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.  So that is teaching so many other people about the life cycle of honey bees.
4:  Queen bee and worker bees and a few drones at the very at it was very interesting. Finally at the for station. We played a true or false begin test our knowledge about the life cycle of honey bees here are some things each of us learned. I learned that all worker bees are females. There are hundreds of kinds of the  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.
5:  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.  So I think that's great. You know, you've got very Target audiences, right? You've got Growers. You've got beekeepers Etc. So, how do you how do you fund your extension program? Right. That's one of the discussions in our world is we what we got all these great ideas to reach beekeepers Etc. But that costs money. So how do you generate funding to support your extension program at Michigan State? Yes million dollar question for all of us, right? We've been very fortunate. It is a time that people do really care about bees.
6:  What is it that you and your lab do at Michigan State University in the realm of extension? What is it to you? And what do you do? And what are you trying to achieve? Sure. So the main overarching mission is to respond to practical needs in the agricultural Community my rules a little different than some of the straight beekeeping extension and apiculture is positioned. So when I started I've been at Michigan State for 5 years now in my current position  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are
7:  Recognize the importance and so I would say that we do focus on programs that we can fund. Plus we do have some general funding. So my position itself is funded directly through Michigan State University my I'm funded half through egg by a research and half the MSU Extension. And so that does give me flexibility to kind of operate on things that I find important either way for our extension. We've received funding from both the Michigan commercial.  Purrs and the Michigan Beekeepers Association, we received a grant through MSU Extension to develop like our pollinator Champions Course, but now that has become self funded in that it does bring in money. So that's one of the things that we're trying to do a little more is findings programs that can at minimum be self-supporting so that they can fund the instructors and fund the space and from the bees or whatever we need. We did get a really large.
8:  Because his kidnapping had Witnesses we all knew a bad crime had been committed and something evil had happened.  Back, then I had no children and was far from comprehending how the wetterling's felt. But the news reports were chilling and it all felt hopeless to me when he was taken. I've reviewed tapes at the beginning and I was in shock. I know I was staring off into the distance and Jerry was trying to to ask for help. But our reality was about 50 people turned them in as a suspect because they didn't

They're older brother Gordon felt shaken to his core by their loss. What about the rest of us who didn't even know them? What path do the boys point us toward? I think they Point toward the pursuit of certainty for us beyond their Circle. That's their legacy.  so clearly that's what has motivated right County deputies Jessica Miller and Lance Saul's we must try to learn what happened to them no matter how weak the chance now of finding out
 
Topic 41 gmo food labeling: Some people say we should avoid foods with genetically-modified organisms as ingredients. I would like to learn about GMO food labeling. What are people saying about the pros and cons? What’s the difference between the European and US approaches to GMO food labeling?
0:  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.  Hey, if you're liking this content, Please Subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos.
1:  Take vitamins and synthetic vitamins that are fortifying our food actually increase oxidation, but they're acting is oxidants anything that increases oxidation can increase inflammation and increase your risk of getting insulin resistance. So in summary, yes, it's true that the consume more bread, but they don't enrich it. It's higher quality. They don't snack as much they consume more fat. They consume less vegetable oils.  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.
2:  of them are thin but I will say there's a big difference between the European countries and America. Okay, especially France and even Italy now the French consume a lot more fat the four times as much butter 60% more cheese a hundred eighty grams of fat from animal sources versus the US it's only 72. So in France, they're eating more saturated fats in America. We consume way more vegetable oil.  Like corn oil and soil which are GMO which can lead to insulin resistance. Okay, that alone can actually make you gain weight. They have three times as much pork. They have less high fructose corn syrup. I'll get to this in a second. They tend to keep their traditional foods. Okay, like in America, every single corner has a Thai restaurant in Italian restaurant a Mexican restaurant. You don't see that
3:  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.  There's no denying GMO when it's around it. Yeah, you know what it is.
4:  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.  I just kind of dismissed it because I knew it was a longer flour. So it didn't really work and my setup that I had and I finally took the leap to do it because we were trying to get into the solvent list and we know it's a tried and true as far as washing the flower but you know, I like it now. I'd like to get it back in the garden after growing it finally. How long did you end up running your GMO?
5:  Yeah, you know definitely it's going to affect it. I think just um you as a gardener is going to affect it what you spray what you feed it your environment. There's definitely a lot of variables when it comes to it. But you know as far as what I do I stick to a schedule I try to find genetics at work and that schedule so the GMO was a bit of an adjustment. Even our grape stomp or you know  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.
6:  Yeah, I mean there's definitely a lot of hype behind some strange nowadays but a lot of them stand up to it, you know anything with great flavor draws me and right away. I'm a big grape guy had Tangie for years.  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.
7: Welcome to the dr. Berg healthy Ketone intermittent fasting podcast. Now your host the man taking your health to a whole new level. Dr. Eric Berg.  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of
8:  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of  Site, but even worse than that the glycemic index is a hundred and ten like table sugar is 70. This is a hundred and ten. I don't know of anything that's actually more than that. So you're consuming this sugar that will spike your blood sugar's so much compared to any other foods. Not only that the FDA does not include multiple dextran in the definition of added sugars.
9:  Turmoil and you're starting to weigh the pros and cons of actually changing this thing. Like I know the way that I'm eating is causing some issues, but I also really like whatever the food is. I really like bread. I really like soda. I really like cocktails or wine. And so I don't know is this going to be red is going to be willing am I willing to make this change? Is it going to be worth it to me to do this thing? All right during this stage. You're starting to become more aware of the  Consequences of your behavior, but you're not quite convinced that it's worth it. You're still seeing way more in the cons in the negative column. Then you are in the pros in the positive column. So you're not there yet stage 3 is what they call the preparation stage and this is when you've kind of trip the switch you've realized that you do actually want to make a change now it is going to be worth it and you're starting to collect information. All right, so if I did want to do this
 
Topic 42 fyre festival: Fyre Festival was a failed music festival which was planned to happen in 2017 on Bahamas. The festival was marketed through a number of social media channels, but the organisers did not deliver what they had promised the attendees in terms of accommodation and other infrastructure, and many of the billed artists never showed. The festival was the topic for several documentaries in 2019. I want to hear first person accounts of the festival, interviews with people associated with the festival, and about the legal repercussions.
0:  DM me a tray of culture cast I usually reserve the official like Instagram account for anything related to the podcast. You guys can always reach out to me on my personal account a temuco POTUS if you want to as well, but okay with all that being said, let's get into this episode. So today we have on the festival finesse ER his name is Brian, but that is basically like his YouTube name. That's what he goes by the festival finesse. ER you guys can most likely find him roaming around a music festival hanging out on the  Mosh Pit front and center he wears these bright tie-dye shirts with his logo on them. He is a Jersey native to is awesome. So that's been really cool. We both have lived near each other which is really cool. We hung out at Ever After Festival. So he's in some of my Vlogs if you guys want to go check him out. And yeah and he's a content creator. He's got some really awesome Vlogs and music festival tips. That's his whole thing. He's really just trying to show people how they can finesse music festivals. And again, he's very into bass music.
1:  Made and marketed so spent a lot of time researching that and I'll post a lot about that in my newsletter. I think and on my patreon page as well. I actually don't have any travel until maybe South by Southwest will see I might be going there and I'm also probably going to be at this music festival / conference called tree fort Music Fest, which is in Boise. I've never been to Idaho at all. So this should be an interesting experience and I think it's like catered For towards  An artist as well cool. So yeah, very excited for that aside from that. It's the next year is like totally open. I find with a lot of this travel is difficult for me to like have a clear idea of where I'm going to be like more than five six months in advance, but I definitely want to travel a lot for my book just to interview people like I want to make it as International Global as possible. So I slept a little bit of planning around that like one which which artists will be going to stick with me and then

6:  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.  Blogs on my YouTube channel, which will be going out the end of this week and over the weekend. I got so much footage you guys I really went in this year. So it was also my first media pass which is super exciting literally was one of my main goals and I can't it feels surreal that that happened like when I started all this I was like, oh my God if I could create content and just travel to music festivals and do that like as a job, that would be my goal. So to actually do that this past weekend and be able to come back and have all this in
7:  Use these past few weeks. I'm kind of loving it having new people on every week sharing some stories of other ravers people in the EDM Community companies. I'm having so much fun doing this. So I hope you guys are liking all these episodes if you are new this week. Thank you so much for checking out the podcast. We have a lot of fun over here. I cover everything from music festival tips and advice to just topical content in the EDM Community some EDM news stuff about different artists. I try and  Things to you guys when I can do music festival reviews after I attend different shows and things like that. And then yeah anything that sort of like comes up in this industry. That's like an interesting topic or something that I think should be discussed or we should have a conversation about that sort of like my goal for this podcast and really just like starting a conversation to talk about the positivity in this community because that's like the biggest thing that the EDM Community has given back to me and why I love going to music festivals why I love raving and interacting.
8:  If that I want to share with you guys, so now we can get into the episode which I'm super super pumped about. So this past weekend, I actually had the opportunity to attend my first bass music festival and my first music festival in Canada. So two and one which is incredible and so there were a lot of first and I really hope to do a lot of Festival reviews here on this podcast. I wanted to dedicate an episode fully to talking about this experience what it was like so that you guys are a little bit more informed if you want to check this Festival out next year, you know a little bit  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.
9:  Just take it feel it and move to the side. So like the workflow can keep happening because I'll see a lot of people like struggling to close their camera back on their just blocking the people from going to the front to keep filling it. So just step to the side so that the line can keep going. Okay. I'm going to talk about totems you guys this one was popping up a lot on social media recently. I don't know why this somebody I think it started on Reddit or on Twitter and it just spread to all of social media, but people were like having debates about toad.  Mm etiquette. So if you don't know what a totem is basically at a music festival, it's a large like PVC pipe and it'll have either a sign or artwork or something at the top and people will like carry this pole around and I love them. They can either be funny like expressive whatever it is. It's basically like a sign so I think they're in the most entertaining part of music festivals. I love seeing what people come up with they crack me up. I have so many pictures from EDC last year and from other
 
Topic 43 hong kong protests: Since early 2019, more or less continuous protests have taken place in Hong Kong, to mark popular displeasure with various aspects of power shifting from the local governing council to the Chinese central government. Students from the many Hong Kong universities have been at the forefront of the protests. I want to know more about who is protesting along with the students and what the popular sentiment in the general Hong Kong population is.
0:  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.  With cheap drums up just avoid the protest.
1:  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.
2:  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that
3:  he actually talks about Hong Kong here. And I'm gonna as it he was in he was in Hong Kong as I write from my four-star hotel and calm in Hong Kong which cost me a mere $25 per day I cannot but think about how erroneously risk is priced into the market when I arrived high at Hong Kong airport was eerily quiet with tourist avoiding it unbeknownst to them. However Hong Kong continues to be one of the safest place place.  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.
4:  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that  Hong Kong Polytechnic University and when they tried to storm it there was a fierce resistance. So people inside the university were they ended up barricading themselves into the school and to the university and fighting back with like petroleum bombs and arrows and Molotov cocktails. It was extremely interesting to watch and these people are fighting for
5:  Outsource our manufacturing and other jobs all over the place. Our immigration system is just fucked. So to me I'm like look, I wish we could do something with Hong Kong, but I don't see what we can do and then on a principle from a principled stand point. I don't know if there's anything we should do except stand in solidarity, but beyond that I it's not our fight if that makes sense. So anyway, what's going on currently is?  The students that were in the Hong Kong University, I guess they were running out of food and resources. So they all decided to flee and a bunch of people from the city are helping them get out. A lot of them are helping. So if you're not watching what's going on in Hong Kong, you should it's so it's just fascinating and we are seeing in real time how people are fighting for their freedoms because they know and I've said this already like this situation only had a couple ways to go either they get
6:  So but how would John so how would China starting riots make them appealing to Hong Kong intern doesn't just show that they can't control them.  The Chinese government had one the protesters to not play with fire not to underestimate the firm resolve the central government and not to mistake restraint for weakness. China could also be making the association that the Hong Kong government alone can't deal with such manic. So it is required for China to step in by the tenth week of protests. The airports are shut down due to protests on the 11th of August and the foot on the 4th of September Carrie Lam announced that she would withdraw the extradition brought together, but protesters said it was too little too late.
7:  So as people may or may not have been paying attention the situation in Hong Kong has not stopped. So I talked about this months back. I mean probably four or five months ago talking about the situation in Hong Kong how I legitimately did not see a Way Forward except confrontation or there's really only two ways the situation is going to resolve itself. Either Beijing is  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.
8:  By this point here is what the protesters still want one the withdrawal of the right description used about the 12th of June protests to an amnesty for all arrested protesters 3 and independent inquiry into alleged police brutality for universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong's chief executive and legislative Council and five the resignation of Carrie Lam.  I'm confused. China has one of the largest military forces. So why haven't they just taken Hong Kong by force? Well while this would spark a massive backlash in the International Community the actual main reason China have kept pushing to completely take control over Hong Kong is due to the fact that this would destroy their proposition to unify Taiwan under there one country two systems rule the opposite of already unfolded in Hong Kong have led to popularity leaning towards the governing party in Taiwan who favor continued Defiance of Beijing China.
9:  Is real bad, you know and we can't that's it. That's a whole separate. That's a whole separate thing to get into you know, you got to devote a lot of time too, but I don't know. We've got a precursor to an upcoming episode. Yeah, we've got somebody from Hong Kong who's coming on the show to talk about, you know her experience with yeah and what exactly it's so now, I mean, it would be interesting, you know, even on this University campus we have we have students from mainland China right where the polarizing by the vast majority. This is not to say that everyone in I'm not going to generalize and say this  But but are pretty much in line with the the mainland Chinese government policy on Hong Kong and it's you know, it's a complicated issue but it comes down to there's a list of Demands that the Hong Kong protesters, you know, they want but so I know he's the NBA is now like somehow the NBA is now involved with the issues between Hong Kong and Beijing, you know, and it can't wait it gets out what we're talking about earlier. It's all it's all circle. Now, we're all could everything's connected now mmm
 
Topic 44 thanksgiving comedy special: I remember hearing on the radio a comedy special recorded for Thanksgiving by Jack Benny.  Can I find it as a podcast?
0:  Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42 ones dream is constantly evolving rising and falling changing course this happens in every job. But because I have worked in comedy for 25 years. I can probably speak best about my own profession.  Way back in the 1940s. There was a very very funny man named Jack Benny. He was a giant star easily. One of the greatest comedians of his generation and a much younger man named Johnny Carson wanted very much to be Jack Benny in some way. He's in some ways. He was but in many ways he wasn't he emulated Jack Benny, but his own quirks and mannerisms along with the changing medium pulled him in a different direction.
1:  Way back in the 1940s. There was a very very funny man named Jack Benny. He was a giant star easily. One of the greatest comedians of his generation and a much younger man named Johnny Carson wanted very much to be Jack Benny in some way. He's in some ways. He was but in many ways he wasn't he emulated Jack Benny, but his own quirks and mannerisms along with the changing medium pulled him in a different direction.  And yet his failure to completely become his hero made him the funniest person of his generation David Letterman. Wanted to be Johnny Carson and was not and as a result my generation of comedians wanted to be David Letterman and none of us are my peers and I have all missed that Mark in a thousand different ways. But the point is this it is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us

5:  What does Thanksgiving look like in our families any fun Thanksgiving Traditions that we implemented this year Thanksgiving so much and it's a two-eyed honestly kind of funny because we lived out of state and closer to family not closer to family different years and I just I love experiences of both. Like I'll always love spending time with my family, but there's something about being away from family and creating a family Thanksgiving with close friends. That is that will always be special memories for us, you know. Yeah. I know a lot of times you're not everyone's close to their families, but  Having the chance to choose that and to make it into something because Thanksgiving can be kind of you can get homesick during that time. You're not my family. So I haven't even thought about it that way. Yeah, I loved just finding like a friendsgiving dinner is so fun to do and to put on and we did that we're far but we usually just switch on and off with me husband's family and do it that way. What about you guys? Yeah Thanksgiving. I feel like is I guess a couple of New Traditions that have been kind of

Do you have a vision or better yet a sound for this you need to convince Thanksgiving music take a test drive right now. Okay. I think we can agree. The Thanksgiving TV special is also underrated.

Topic 45 drafting tight ends: I heard a podcast about strategies for drafting tight ends in football.  I’d like to find it again.
0:  10 times last year pretty ridiculous what you know speaking of tight ends Tom before we get into our rankings. We really should break down the some of the news that's come out today. Apparently the Giants are sending an MRI of Evan engram foot to dr. Robert Anderson. Who's one of the foremost foot specialists in the country. We have no update on that right now, but it does appear that the Giants are concerned about Evan engrams foot injury. Which would I mean look, he's a top  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.
1:  Oh and obviously knows a little floor offense and then Max Williams of the Ravens another really good blocking tight end well-rounded run and pass blocking. So that's the kind of tight end. I think they should bring in veteran short-term inexpensive who can block so you don't see a to tight end system with Jimmy Graham and Jared Cook at all. I don't I think it's too expensive 20 million to the tight end position is a lot. All right and Maggie, what do you think? Just should they go after cook it? What do you see the  Workers doing there Paul and I agree on everything today and it's not fun. I think I wholeheartedly agree. I would like to see the Packers address the tight end position maybe in the with the 44th pick in the second round. I think my preference would be to see them go edge o line or maybe Edge even with the the first round, but I also definitely agree that there needs to be a veteran in the lineup and I broke down the tight end.
2:  And that depth chart spot that could maybe prevent some of these other guys from from really opening up into the offense. All right. So let's move on to signing players. I know it's weird for us here in Packer land to actually think about being active in free agency. It's not something that we are really, you know used to under the Ted Thompson regime. It was all about drafting develop goodykoontz.  To want to be very active in free agency. It's so I want to get two things. I want to start with this tight end has been an area of concern for the Packers. You know, Jimmy Graham got he signed last year. That was the big-name free agent. The goons brought in didn't really live up to what every Packer fan kind of had hoped that he would live up to sounds like they're going to bring them back and you know, and but then the other thing
3:  And to play tight end and that obviously worked out tremendously as he was Pro Football Focus is number one graded Tenon and all of college football last year from receiving standpoint. And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.
4:  Mr. Watt is going to start filling in kind of a tight end / full-back position. So that's intriguing me dude. I mean, it's like fun training yard football. But like the guy hasn't played tight end. I don't know intriguing it will see if it were a lot of fans. A lot of fans have been throwing up the let's turn on the gates Pat signal and bring them home, but I just didn't know I just don't know what what that does for us.  So if that makes us better, you know, well, it'd be nice to see Gates back just you know on a personal level, but I know that they have let's say they promoted tight end Steven Anderson to the squad and I overheard him. Yeah, me neither Matt. So Cole was a tight end coming to the practice squad and hate Kyle, who else is coming to the price? I remember something you said a couple weeks ago would be kind of fun. What who's on our practice squad now my boy Quentin
5:  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.  Might wanna wanna might want to stash somebody here this week Mike a sickie is you know, kind of emerging here a little bit no offense, but that doesn't really do any good this week because they're owned by but you know, maybe Jared Cook was dropped, you know, he's gonna finally get the see some extended play with Drew Brees here only really played five quarters with them to start the season here. So the other there's some guys out there even Jacob Hollister. We talked him up a little bit on the waiver wire podcast Russell Wilson has thrown 32% of his touchdown passes to
6:  AC Hayward on the outside so you know expectations should be a little bit lower for those guys. I think this is a spot where Darren Waller has to bounce back here. It's been kind of quiet here to catch games the last and the last two games for them so that you know, that's not going to cut it. I mean the tight end position has been very brutal here, but you know, he's got it that needs to bounce back and I know the numbers say this matchup isn't good, you know tight ends are averaging just like three-and-a-half catches against the Chargers this year.  But they've only faced the top tight ends they faced so far this year Jimmy Graham and Darren fell so, you know, sometimes the tight end numbers especially can be a little bit deceiving because you know, there's just not a lot of great Titan options in the league. So this should be a good tight end game though. I mean, we've probably touch on the the Chargers passing game here a little bit. It's shaping up pretty well hit a fairly Rivers is you know, he's his numbers of bounce back here. He's just had you know poorly
7:  I'll be back but his skill set still very raw and I'm not going to trust them as that number two or three option yet. Don't tell Andi Herman that he loves that guy. So if I was the Packers, I would stick with graham Tom Ian draft one early and then go sign a veteran on a one-year deal. Maybe two tops for a couple million some names that come to mind are Luke Stocker. Here's what the Tennessee Titans he was rated the fifth-best past protection tight end by Pro Football Focus.  Oh and obviously knows a little floor offense and then Max Williams of the Ravens another really good blocking tight end well-rounded run and pass blocking. So that's the kind of tight end. I think they should bring in veteran short-term inexpensive who can block so you don't see a to tight end system with Jimmy Graham and Jared Cook at all. I don't I think it's too expensive 20 million to the tight end position is a lot. All right and Maggie, what do you think? Just should they go after cook it? What do you see the
8:  Who should consider in free agency or do you stick with Jimmy Graham? And then I know a lot of people love the tight ends coming in the draft you stick with Jimmy Graham, maybe draft a tight end and developed that way or do you go out and try to spend money on Jared Cook? I think you do a bit of a combination of that Jimmy Graham's do almost 13 million this season and it like you said, it sounds like they're going to be bringing him back for sure and Jared Cook. He's estimated to make almost 7 million this year on the  The open market so I don't see them bring in both. And I mean that's 20 million in the tight end position. I do think that they should invest early in the draft within you know, the 12th pick I would prefer to go to an edge but at 30 or 40 for if they take you know or Smith Jr. He's still there. No a Fant if you still there I'd be happy with that. But I think they still have to dive into free agency because right now Jimmy Graham's the only tight end under contract Robert Tanya is an exclusive rights free agent and will
9:  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.  Ago or marcedes Lewis before last season, you can get the blocking tight and or take them in brown for five or six take, you know, take the blocking tight end in wrote in round four or five or six next year. So I'm not concerned about the way Sternberg a looks. I agree with it. I think a year in an NFL strength and conditioning program is going to be a huge deal for him. But I think he's as advertised as well. I have a little bit of concern about him just in the sense that I thought he
 
Topic 46 missouri quilt mom: I listened to a podcast about a stay-at-home mom in Missouri who opened a quilt company and I would like to hear it again.
0:  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to
1:  Okay, and so then my Five-Year Plan is so I spent seven years living a dream. Basically. Yeah, it was a dream seven years living that dream and then I quit abruptly to be a stay-at-home mom. And so the thing for me is like I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't quit my job to have  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that
2:  no, you're a stay-at-home mom.  Do you feel like that would be suffering?
3:  I love I love hearing that because I think there's a lot of people in our audience right now who kind of fall under that same almost like ideology. It's like this is what my parents did and this is what I'm going to do two and that's not a bad thing. I mean, my mom was a stay-at-home mom my dad work from home. So that was like a different thing that my friends had but oh that sounds fun. It was a lot of fun because like there were times. It's like Dad. Let's go outside and play baseball and he would drop what he was doing.  He would throw the ball with me in the backyard and it was the greatest. I love it. Yeah, it was so good. Ellie's parents were the same way. Her mom was a stay-at-home. Mom. Her dad went to work and look at us now. We're full time YouTuber. So it's like it's a little bit different but you know, that's not to say that it's a bad thing. It's just I feel like a lot of people need to hear that. It's okay to do something different. There's more than one right way to do things and I love the way that you found it out.
4:  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to  Time to figure that out. I was listening to the love our podcast and they had some guests on there and they were talking about how like in this when Melissa was going through her similar transition as far as like her career path to becoming an entrepreneur in doing out things. She has this thing where she's like space and Grace like give me the space in the grace to be able to figure things out. But her guest on the podcast was like not only space and Grace but
5:  I feel like  Being a sing. I'm a stay-at-home. Mom is like Typecast like it's not just that you know what I'm saying? Because you know you do a lot more.
6:  First of all, you're not just a stay-at-home mom. You're very much a lot more than that.  You know, I mean like I think you have tons of ideas and talents and things that you can do.
7:  Now if I if you were telling me like yo, I need this and I would say I don't think you need that. Like if you were say hey, I need a day off or I need to go hang out with my friends or whatever and I was to say  no, you're a stay-at-home mom.
8:  No acid, there was no because I'm a kind of men they want it to be about them. Yeah, they made to be they don't really heavy in China. They don't necessarily have an interest in what you've got to say what you've got to do that. Well what you've done today, they want it to be about about them. Some women do want to be yes at home. And there's nothing I'm not giving it but I just it's not for me. I can't imagine I will lose my shit. I kept that even if I can completely understand why you would want to be a stay-at-home mom though. Like that's why I want to be a snap.  You're the first I'm gonna yeah, like if it was brilliant because it's not it's not everyone's portion. Like some women actually don't have a choice. They probably love to be at home looking at raising their kids, but they physically do not especially if you live in London, it's so hard you have to go to work. And so I totally get it but I mean God willing I hopefully am in that position where I thought I would want to be a stay-at-home mom for the first few years. I think I want to be there. Yeah, because my mom was a stay-at-home mom and we are in school and obviously when you're a kid, you don't really think about it because that's just my minute. You just come home. Yeah.
9:  Being a sing. I'm a stay-at-home. Mom is like Typecast like it's not just that you know what I'm saying? Because you know you do a lot more.  Yeah, space and Grace, I guess I totally understand that.

2:  List of bye. Bye. Bye, you know, that's it's just such a turn-off. It is a turn-off. One of the things I do is I ask people to take a picture of themselves with my book and I'll create collages and I'll just Express enthusiasm. I love seeing people's beautiful faces with my book so you can you can share those types of things. You're not overtly selling the book but people will read the title and the like that sounds interesting and so I  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people
3:  because I have enough privacy. It's like a to be read pile, right? Yeah where I'm like, okay, I think that this could Inspire because it's about this bubble up and at the end I was like, so if you have any recommendations for books about young women trying to find themselves in the world like 20 year olds or a book that gets a little weird. Please recommend it and multiple people recommended sourdough and they were like, it's by the same author who wrote mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore and I  Like that's so crazy because mr. Penumbra's was such a big book and I never heard anything about sourdough. Like I never heard anyone mention true. Yeah, so I looked it up and I was like, yeah, this actually does sound kind of cute. Maybe I don't know I'll kill it was like now in the back of my mind and now last week raelene had visited here and we went to a book shop together and I saw this book just randomly on it on a sales table for seven dollars and fifty cents and I was like, okay. Yeah.
4:  We talked about this in the interview, which I thought was super fascinating to the people who have written a book have more Authority or that are legit. And literally that doesn't mean that at all, you know, there are people who literally just get book contracts and put out books in their shit. We talked about the still Harmony nice. I haven't read her book yet, but I'm sure that if I read it that I would like it right because I'm sure it's going to be real if you make her bad. It doesn't make her wrong. It doesn't make her any less ice.  I see what you mean, whatever but because she's written a book as a book now. She's more exact. She's are we nice author? Exactly. No and and how you're not somebody in this community unless you've produced a deck or you have written a book and how that somehow solidifies your place in this see that but I also like 100% I like I see exactly what you're saying. But also our community has an amazing job of recognizing small Talent like
5:  A 2012 event Nat Geo Adventurer of the year. He is a author of 13 books. He's a motivational speaker, you know adventure of the grand sort of like, you know cycling around the world for four years as well as just micro Adventures that he's talked about in his blogs and his books and now his podcast and so this interview with allister's is all about the different channels of sharing his story how he kind of has approached each what's going  on on across the you know, the bookie just launched the podcast and just as general perspective on life and how to fuse Adventure into it. It was really great chat. Yeah. I can't even believe it like it. Was it spoke to me on such a deep level. So I know it's going to resonate with you all as well. So, please enjoy our interview with Alistair Humphreys Alistair. So good to have you on the Stoke cast. How you doing?
6:  Today, so as you know generation I believe removed to me that was scathing was literally what I say about every single book I come in contact with and okay guys. So that's most of the time not their fault. It's normally like the Publishers that are like Precious. I know that now but when I wrote this back in 2015, I didn't know about Publishers. I thought that people wrote a book and sent it out, you know, and so I was like, why would she write this? You know, I was sad I can't believe it and so guys  I um, I'm at home without I'm at home by myself. Okay? I see a notification come up that I've gotten a friend request on Facebook none. Other than the author of this.
7:  That collab and I read each other's effort. And I know they can write but once that collaboration happened is like is not how I thought it was going to be. Yeah, I do. I'm not I'm not big on collaboration. Yeah, I've seen it happen before I've read a collab where it was like obvious who wrote would any kind of like right and see I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah. It was like now one one book. I did want to leave. I did like by two ought to do was trust no bitch. Bye.  Cash and Nene you really didn't know which author wrote was because both all the characters was like some some Thug as motherfucker. So, you know people will do my sneaky and conniving so it's like you really did not know who wrote it and that's why I really like that Series. Yeah, that makes sense. I
8:  The book club and you share your thoughts, right? And you know that at least some authors are seeing probably like some chatter on every this is what I found and this is not meant to be conceded. This is like literal fact almost every single one of the authors that we have covered like with if it's a book. I know that they are aware of the of it being done. Yeah of the book because they saw a spike in sales what the fuck's going on probably or I've reached out to them or  You know like for whatever reason yeah for there's like there's there's a lot of reasons for sure. Do you feel like that makes you I don't think that you're the type to feel censored but would you think twice if you knew that the person that wrote a book was watching Always. Hmm, and that's not really fair for the ones that I don't think are watching. But at the same time, I think it's a good reminder for me that these are people people these are Creations. These are babies that they made so while I think
9:  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people  People who have podcasts people who write blogs people who post regularly and just write them and say, you know, I thought you might be interested in a free copy of my book. Which would you like me to send you one and you don't ask them, please write a review or whatever you I mean it just sort of takes the beauty of the gift away when you have when you immediately make it Tit for Tat, so I always buy extra copies of my

2:  Sex is not like scissoring which is not real. It's not a thing. It doesn't work wasn't I know but I just I was like, this is dope. This is huge. It was such a small thing, but it was such a like empowering thing because we see, you know, we see pound town for hetero couples all the time. So it was just nice to see a switch up and it be intimate and beautiful and sexy and not not kind of like overly sexualizing them and the way that like a lot of  X lesbian couples can be made on TV. It was just like this is sex and it's dope and they're having a good time. Yes. Um, I really enjoyed it. I feel like the audience enjoyed it too. Sad to see someone. No, but also we get a look at Nola's X's. I remember when season one and and I was like damn I wonder if any of the guys are going to come back. I wonder how they're going to do this because if anyone watched the original movie It Ends how season 1 ended but that's all Spike Lee did was just this one movie. So sometimes when you take a movie and you make it into a
3:  percent off federal and state filing  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.
4:  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.  Story of a pivotal scene where Jesus who's played by Future NBA Hall of Famer Ray. Allen is supposed to be his father in one-on-one game. It starts with you asking Spike a question about the movie swell, and there's a fizzle famous story and I feel like we want we've heard it from other people but here from the from you the one-on-one game. Yes. All right.
5:  X lesbian couples can be made on TV. It was just like this is sex and it's dope and they're having a good time. Yes. Um, I really enjoyed it. I feel like the audience enjoyed it too. Sad to see someone. No, but also we get a look at Nola's X's. I remember when season one and and I was like damn I wonder if any of the guys are going to come back. I wonder how they're going to do this because if anyone watched the original movie It Ends how season 1 ended but that's all Spike Lee did was just this one movie. So sometimes when you take a movie and you make it into a  I'm like damn. What are they going to do with season two? We got to see the guys and we seen the guys we've seen Jamie working it out with his wife / ex-wife. It looks like they want a divorce in the divorce is on the table. We see Greer kind of just living his best life and still being a hot ass hole and getting a beautiful man. And she's and Noland we're still hanging out and we also see Mars kind of try to live as best life and losing his job and getting kicked out of the house with his sister. So do you guys have a favorite guy? And were you expecting all three of them to be back?
6:  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.  In mounts and he walks in by himself. No Handler. No extra person. He doesn't say too much and it wasn't till he sat down and we actually started recording and he goes what's up young brothers and we all laugh but I realize oh, he's here to have a good time. Like he and he that's what he let us know. He'd listen to the podcast more than one episode and he reference ever there episode. I mean, I understand this and I think Henderson the only reason this podcast can exist is because of the four movies that Spike did with Denzel. Yeah.
7:  Suzanne gatha. Yes. Yes. So the lady that plays Nola Towanda wise actually had to turn down a role in Captain Marvel. Whoa, which is so crazy because of the time conflicts on the scheduling conflicts that happened with this show which is such a crazy huge franchise to turn down. Like I always wonder like what would have happened if she was able to take on that role? How would it have changed her?  Career, but I think that also shows some like loyalty and commitment there that you're going to stick out with a Netflix show like a Spike Lee. I Spike Lee Netflix show over like a billion-dollar franchise that would have been so, you know, you know what I think I am happy that she turned it down because if you think about it, like she's got to have it is De Wanda like the one is the star she will now go down in history and being like she is spot. She was the head person. Whereas I Captain Marvel have been great for her bank account and great for her and her husband.
8:  Because like I don't like subtlety and I Spike Lee doesn't like subtlety and I think what issues like that where it really is affecting the lives of people like with what's all boys name that got arrested last season and is out. Oh Pop. Oh Pop. Oh like I love seeing like very real tangible examples of what the effects of gentrification has on people like with him and with Mars and love it kind of getting thrown in your face to the point where it's uncomfortable because it's like this is real. Yeah. Yes, I agree with you but I do agree that the end was a little long but that's like this.  Polly history Jack has a thing where he takes something like a piece of art and he will literally stretch the scene out for 20 minutes like okay. Yes. I was still going so that's like a thing with Spike Lee like I love but that I had the same reaction where I was like, okay this little long but I love it because as your even though you're a little annoyed you like. Okay Spike. I see what you're saying. Yeah, that's what I got for me, but the second was definitely hell along. Thank you spike before we close out episode 1 because we're going
9:  Career, but I think that also shows some like loyalty and commitment there that you're going to stick out with a Netflix show like a Spike Lee. I Spike Lee Netflix show over like a billion-dollar franchise that would have been so, you know, you know what I think I am happy that she turned it down because if you think about it, like she's got to have it is De Wanda like the one is the star she will now go down in history and being like she is spot. She was the head person. Whereas I Captain Marvel have been great for her bank account and great for her and her husband.  Yeah, but she just would have kind of been like a plus one which isn't a bad role but I just think what she's got to have it. This is her. This is my home. She gets to have full control of her character and shows loyalty to fight and I will also say yes to all of that but I also say Hollywood has this tendency that once there's a person of color who's popping. They want to they and they want to play the representation in game. They push that person onto everything onto every project. We've seen it, you know and Asian communities in the Latino community.

Topic 52 fauci interview: An article about COVID-19 referenced an interview with Dr. Fauci that took place when the virus had not yet reached the US.  I would like to listen to it.
0:  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview  View and the problem I have with all those interviews where they got these actual guys that like kind of like except Article 13. It's always like 10 minutes and they got two minutes to speak themselves and to respond. Maybe they got one minute. So if they ever are in a corner where they have to like say, oh my God, I'm actually deciding this because of this and that there was getting cut off. So what would be really interesting would be like a discussion where it like has no end like where they can really trapped and him so they would
1:  That they're sort of not buying the fact that it how did you know it was upstairs if you've never been upstairs and now you're still talking about not going upstairs, even though it clearly you clearly have bit upstairs, you know, it is a just digging his own hot. You're right and we've found this a lot with clients that are used to be in listen to clients that are used to people not interrupting them or questioning them and obviously prince Andrew is a prime example of that. The truth is a journalist is looking for an answer and whether it's a print interview a radio interview or in this case a TV interview.  You've got control of your answer. So you answer the question the way you want to answer and then you stop and this is not what happens with so many people in power is there used to be in listen to and they go on and on and on especially someone like Andrew who feels is got a point to prove and if I keep talking these guys are going to love me eventually because everyone loves me and that's the attitude he heard he just couldn't stop talking and we took we took as well about legal speak corporate speak. Yeah this sort of you know, this I was
2:  So I always so I also do off camera interviews like just for my job. So there's like  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.
3:  Hamilton, but yeah, I didn't I think the first time I like actually listen to my own music was probably in like 7th or 8th grade when I was just obsessed with the Phantom of the Opera because I watched the movie and then I watched the show at like Manheim Township or something and I was like, I love it so much and then I just like listen to the soundtrack. Like usually you don't like I  Listen to other people's music. I don't have like a style of my own you like get it. Do you like understand them through that or you just think it's interesting? I mean
4:  Exactly. Nothing else behind what's the point? There's got to be a pond behind it because like there is going to be the EU elections. You know, I think it's gonna be I think it's something like China like, you know saying there's like a bigger master plan behind it. Yes, not shyness like to control all the platforms to make sure you know propaganda make sure nothing wrong gets to the people and I feel it's something more in that direction than than like. Oh, we don't want because why would the EU K? Why would that you politicians care about copyrights?  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview
5:  No, I just like don't which is why I can listen to normal music while doing homework. Hmm. Like I can just listen to anything. I'm not like I can't have words because I'm not less. Yeah. Anyway, they're just there. Yeah, they'll distract me. I definitely can't do that. I definitely used to be like that. But sometimes you just gotta put a song on repeat just a little more. Okay. I'm not with the Spotify not not make a playlist. Just one song. I've done that before. Um, even though I could just  beat it. You took the effort it because one of it on their 70s because when I would be like hey Google play my name of song playlist because you couldn't tell it to repeat the song because it would do it once and then move on to the next song. So it was like out of necessity, you know, no necessity is the mother of invention. It's true and then there's some songs that it's like, oh I listened to this two thousand times because I listened to it on repeat as I read the Harry Potter 0
6:  They dig my parents. Don't just like listen to music. My mom will listen to like Bob Marley like Cat Stevens or something, but my dad never listens to music the only time I ever listen to music as a kid was like when we were driving somewhere and we'd have 90.3 on yeah the time but other than that like we just never listen to music, but that's weird too because you get a lot of reading and that's nice words into because I spent ninety.  percent of my childhood just reading right so then I would be like you'd be likely to also get that with lyrics maybe because I definitely didn't used to pay as much attention to lyrics like two or one year ago or whatever just
7:  No, I think that like these are companies that most people don't know the name of even if the you see like powered by out brain. It doesn't mean it doesn't register with you when you're on the site and anytime someone writes about them. I feel like whenever I come across an article about them. It's like these are the people who provide us with the lowest quality content. Nobody. Yeah. It's never like an appreciation for the place that tells you how to lose weight by eating beetles or whatever, right? So I say like, hey we want to do an interview with you guys and they were both like what specifically do you want to talk to us about and so I explained to them.  What I was interested in and they were like, yeah, we'll get back to you. But in the meantime, I was contacted by another person who had written one of these articles about Matt and Liz and she claims not to remember having written it but she told me about how the company she writes for uses. This specialized software that is specifically designed to find trending articles that are very popular that they can then just copy and throw up on their sites. It's called buzzsumo, which is the yeah. Why is it like in the
8:  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.  I mean the two girls from Euphoria were amazing Paris Hilton was also one of my favorite epic just because not even from my own point of view, but others like my friends and co-workers and everybody were like you were so they said I was so myself on stage with her which just is awesome because so great you could tell that it was an entertaining interview of people thought that we vibed with each other totally. Um,
9:  It was four days straight. What up to the gate? I mean to be fair. It's a good start. I don't remember Googling. What's the most on time songs ever listen to the song because I was like Howard but then it was like me way more than that. Yeah, that's just a person who's listened to the same song on repeat for like 12 years. And then the ask would probably gonna end up my question is yeah is the reason I don't listen to music because my family doesn't listen to music my family.  They dig my parents. Don't just like listen to music. My mom will listen to like Bob Marley like Cat Stevens or something, but my dad never listens to music the only time I ever listen to music as a kid was like when we were driving somewhere and we'd have 90.3 on yeah the time but other than that like we just never listen to music, but that's weird too because you get a lot of reading and that's nice words into because I spent ninety.
 
Topic 53 recommended books for entrepreneurs: I was told about a podcast that recommended good books for entrepreneurs.  I’m trying to find that episode.
0:  I years ago read the called the read aloud handbook by Jim to release. Oh, yes. I read that one. She wasn't yeah. Yeah, and then where she's just throwing it out there where one of our favorite books that both of us have recently read is called the read aloud family by Sarah Mackenzie. So she was inspired by Jim. Yeah. It's an incredible book that we both really recommend and we'll give you a lot of insight into  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so
1:  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so  We're going to talk about why do we even need to read aloud and some benefits from it? Yeah reading aloud is a great and easy way to help your children reach their full potential. What does that mean? I will so as I was Googling it that's like on therapists and education websites like it was everywhere. Yeah, like this is a huge Foundation the principle of a way to help your child to reach their full potential. It seems so simple right? It's kind of weird that something
2:  Do you get experience if you don't have experience normally it's having great experiences having making bad decisions. And so you need to do first bad decisions that you will have great experience. But another thing you can do is, you know, you can read books. You can read books about other entrepreneurs. You can listen to your podcast and listen and I think this is something that helps.  Listen and read a lot of podcasts and entrepreneur books and then you start with a single project and you try to to to start with an MVP and start directly with marketing and talk to people and if you see that people have something in their eyes and they're like, oh, this is a cool thing then you're on to something. But if you need to explain if you need to
3:  With it. But again, what do you got to lose but eating healthy but one day I was at the chiropractor and I heard this woman who had been in the hospital for four like on and off for weeks and she was pretty young probably in her forties maybe early 50s and she was explaining how sick she'd been to this the receptionist and I couldn't help but hear it. I was 2 feet away. So when I was done I said hey if you have you tried, you know celery  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and
4:  Her innate Beauty skincare business. So that's going to be super interesting something. I'll talk about later on in the podcast as it grows. Thanks to 10x. I got the invitation to be a part of this but not to digress too much. Yeah, this this podcast is dedicated to all beginner intermediate and advanced entrepreneurs out there. Just trying to get better without all the fluff without basically fillers without a  Abundance of guess this is from someone that's really doing it right now every single day and just giving you the absolute best advice. I wish I could have heard period and of course if you aren't old listener, thank you so much for listening. Now, today's episode, of course in yet in the title. You might have noticed I said beginner and intermediate but this also applies to those that are Advanced entrepreneurs as well as these are sometimes things that just get in our way that we still have yet not fixed. So, yes, today's episode is all about
5:  But on the same time be your your hardest critic about it the this is it and this isn't something you could I think you can't boil it down to numbers or maybe somebody tries it but I've never seen it because if somebody figures that out, you know, that's the essence of Entrepreneurship. When do you decide to stop a project? And when you decide to proceed with the project one thing is experience and how  Do you get experience if you don't have experience normally it's having great experiences having making bad decisions. And so you need to do first bad decisions that you will have great experience. But another thing you can do is, you know, you can read books. You can read books about other entrepreneurs. You can listen to your podcast and listen and I think this is something that helps.
6:  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and  She's now on the path because of Anthony Williams and she's on the path of healing where Western medicine and nothing's really been able to help her and release nutrition. So anyway, it's exciting me and I've been I mean, I've read it probably three times and over the last two three years. But anyway, that's what I'm kind of working on and I think it's a great read. I love I love medical medium those of you who interact with me on Instagram. I do celery juice every morning and I've noticed a huge difference in my digestion.
7:  It necessary recommended or completely optional if someone was new to this work to start at the first book. I think it's not going to hurt anybody. That's for sure. I think it'll be helpful but the guides say and they've said it from the beginning that they teach in a one-room schoolhouse house and you know, they meet their students wherever they are, you know, so they're always teaching to the collective. I was told recently that  you know beyond the known realization would be published in Russian and it's the only one of the books that I know of that's going to be published there and I thought well that will be interesting for that readership because they're not going to have the context I tend to tell people when they ask to go where their lead, you know, some people are drawn to one book most of them if the teachings resonate with them and go backwards and you know read up and then go forward to what's next and I think these books, you know, it should be said
8:  All these aspects of the self that are really tethered or tied or waited to fear or in agreement to the denial of the Divine. It's a little like being turned inside out and my experience and that's where they've left us and I don't know what the next book is there teaching some new stuff in the last month or two and workshops that I assume will be the basis for where they go next, but I'm not going to say that for sure because I truly don't know. I don't know the title of the next book is it?  It necessary recommended or completely optional if someone was new to this work to start at the first book. I think it's not going to hurt anybody. That's for sure. I think it'll be helpful but the guides say and they've said it from the beginning that they teach in a one-room schoolhouse house and you know, they meet their students wherever they are, you know, so they're always teaching to the collective. I was told recently that
9:  After all, that's a good idea. This is a book that I think is very polarizing. Yeah, either gonna love it or hate it if you like it. I'll like I should bump it up my list. You should read it right away. Well the book I'm reading is sourdough by Robin Sloan. Okay. So I made a video on my channel recently talking about books that are inspiring my novel. It's kind of a tenuous idea a little bit doesn't work because I don't know if they will inspire my  because I have enough privacy. It's like a to be read pile, right? Yeah where I'm like, okay, I think that this could Inspire because it's about this bubble up and at the end I was like, so if you have any recommendations for books about young women trying to find themselves in the world like 20 year olds or a book that gets a little weird. Please recommend it and multiple people recommended sourdough and they were like, it's by the same author who wrote mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore and I
 
Topic 54 bias in college admissions: I read an article that mentioned a podcast about bias in college admissions.  I would like to listen to it but I don’t know the name of the show.
0:  Daughter and I don't understand I know the college experience because that was one of her excuses. Like I'm just here for the experience. You know, I just wanted I'll go to football games and she was when she mentioned class she was like, I don't really care about it. Yeah. I saw that man to you. She is a Creator on YouTube. So yes, I can in principle be getting Bank.  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.
1:  Yeah, what can you can you send me that article when I get off and I love to take a peek at yeah. Yeah, for sure. And for those of you that are listening that want to learn more about this too. I encourage you to jump on LinkedIn if you're on there, if you're a business professional on LinkedIn my page on there is exactly like the podcast it's junior golf keys, and I'm just posting articles just like this that hopefully can help you guys with learning about different aspects of developing young players. And so the article like I said is called wide.  Junior golfers should continue playing multiple Sports and yeah, I'll definitely send it to you that when we wrap up. That's awesome touched on it but being a younger coach and I've only really I've been coaching college golf now for five years and a lot of coaches I go against I've been coaching for you know, 20 30 heck 40 years even in their sixties. And so what I may lack in experience, I mean, this is all I do is, you know, listen these podcasts and read three books and read articles and is trying to absorb as much info as I can, you know, obviously my body is young, but I try to get my
2:  Okay, and and there was a some some stuff in my life. That was like not like less than ideal. And I took it my answer to it was like being angry and frustrated. That's why I like for me like playing football growing up was like a big way like letting out that anger, you know and like, you know, maybe a healthier way of the options. I had presented, you know, yeah and the answer for a while. I would kind of just like like put it away. You know, I just like, okay like and after doing that enough times. I became I think really out of touch with my emotions. Yeah and really like analytically and  Really driven, which I think has like some massive pros and some massive cons. Okay, right and so growing up and maturing and learning about the validity that emotions have in relationships. Yes. You can't eat like you have to listen to your heart. Yeah, and you can't only think and and I think that I think that it's better to make now. This is my bias. I think it's better to make decisions according more to logic to like and reason. Yeah then how you feel, but also I think and so I thought that for so long I also think that you
3:  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.  And is the thing that specifically about this girl was the college experience like come on my you can have a college experience and not go to college. Yeah. I remember people criticize her for that because like you were like, why are you being so ungrateful? Like this is an opportunity. This is a blessing you're into a great College. Like why are you being so great for then? She apologized obviously people are gonna forget. Apparently. She apologized. Yeah, but I mean now when people know how she got it apparently, you know, Mom push her she may be grass out. That's how we do.
4:  Really driven, which I think has like some massive pros and some massive cons. Okay, right and so growing up and maturing and learning about the validity that emotions have in relationships. Yes. You can't eat like you have to listen to your heart. Yeah, and you can't only think and and I think that I think that it's better to make now. This is my bias. I think it's better to make decisions according more to logic to like and reason. Yeah then how you feel, but also I think and so I thought that for so long I also think that you  Discount your feelings. You can't write them off totally. Yeah. And in fact, your feelings will tell you a lot of things that you know, but you might not be processing correctly the a super common relationship that probably a lot of people here nothing like a skin relationships. Do you think it's better to trust your gut and like your heart or what? You think it's both both? Okay. And so there's a balcony Mac. But yeah. Yeah, I think that in relationships a lot of people they're in a relationship. They're happy. It's like a good time. They like the
5:  Junior golfers should continue playing multiple Sports and yeah, I'll definitely send it to you that when we wrap up. That's awesome touched on it but being a younger coach and I've only really I've been coaching college golf now for five years and a lot of coaches I go against I've been coaching for you know, 20 30 heck 40 years even in their sixties. And so what I may lack in experience, I mean, this is all I do is, you know, listen these podcasts and read three books and read articles and is trying to absorb as much info as I can, you know, obviously my body is young, but I try to get my  Brain is is experienced as I can until I obviously put in some more time. And so that'd be awesome. I love to see that. Yeah for sure. I'll send it to you. All right, I want to wrap up in one of the things that I started last week. Actually, it's just something new because I retain some feedback from some folks listening is to give a little bit more insight into me. So the last piece of this episode and episodes going forward is I'm going to
6:  This one is like recency bias for me. And if you really know me it wouldn't be that big of a surprise, but I really like a song off the new Tinashe album It's touch-and-go which is so relatable to me, which is kind of like a song about like relationships and the complexities and stuff like that. And for the most part that album I like it. It's just like she does too many kind of trap Beats for  Sure. She just keeps going in over the same kind of sound. She's like trying to hit a sound that's maybe a little over overdone at this point. Yeah, but that song is just like kind of a straight R&B song with like very melodic and blacks on it. And it's just like very nice very nice song nice smooth and so nice. That's that's what that's a good one.
7:  Yeah, I think he made the new beats on a iPad. Oh, yeah, so if you don't get mad Mad Lib for saying though, I'm with that though. I'm with all these so far actually. All right biggest guilty pleasure song that most people wouldn't see you gotta answer the question bro. Where did I said follow the song? Yo, you're wide awake for that. We're just like that's right. All right, because guilty pleasure song that most people would have wouldn't assume you'd really like  This one is like recency bias for me. And if you really know me it wouldn't be that big of a surprise, but I really like a song off the new Tinashe album It's touch-and-go which is so relatable to me, which is kind of like a song about like relationships and the complexities and stuff like that. And for the most part that album I like it. It's just like she does too many kind of trap Beats for
8:  Tails and again, I kind of already described what they did previously so I won't dive into much but again if these mapping stuff is confusing you or your you want to learn it to Great articles. I think you'll really have a grasp on these things after you read them next up. We have an article by suroosh conlou about continuous integration and kind of made me laugh when I read the beginning of it says a few months ago Aaron Patterson tweeted about some three-year-old uncommitted code said that feeling when you work on a patch for three years and it's like 2K lines of code, then you commit it and you hope can  in use integration passes CI passes was like wait a minute three years for a commit like holy shit. So basically, you know, naturally it didn't pass and then you know, he says at this point Martin Fowler chimed in, you know point out that if a patch has been developed for three years is most certainly not continuous integration and that's kind of the main idea of this post by suroosh a lot of people think of CI continuous integration as the tools like he says here, you know, it's like a build server, you know something bit rise buddy bills Travis Etc, you know,
9:  Awesome. Yeah, and we will link the article within the show notes as well. So check check out the show notes. Click on them read the article. It's fantastic and might be the beginning of a new start for you. And if you'd like me to come talk to talk about it or to get a hold of me, and I've been presenting on it quite a bit over the last year. So yeah, let's send you ever everywhere everywhere they want so let's send you there. There you go. Awesome. Well, thanks for chatting Eric, and we will talk to you later. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you.  you
 
Topic 55 malcolm x biography: I heard about a podcast biography of Malcolm X and I would like to listen to it.
0: Are we really free? Hell? No. No, we're not well.  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.
1:  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.  Of how everything he said back then still resonate to this very day. So how far do we really go?
2:  You will find out in 2020.  but Malcolm X
3:  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.  But the society is so rigged up.
4:  People like that. Don't get awarded.  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.
5:  but Malcolm X  I believe was a very courageous man. He really puts so much of himself on the line for the black community and people like that are always under appreciated.
6:  That was going on in the country then as well as now.  So I'm going to go ahead and play this audio so you can hear exactly what Malcolm X was saying about bringing the u.s. To the United Nations.
7:  In controlled person should get sedated so that they can then get some therapy and come off gradually, okay and medication. So then after that you mentioned getting into Muslim is well, I embraced Islam. Yeah. Well, so I saw the movie Malcolm X part of the definitely part of like the experience like of what I went through was all I guess pieces to making me look at my life and kind of ask some simple questions.  I don't know. I just got tired of not being in control of myself and I got tired of seeing for me. It was never really about like religion that was never a religious person. Actually, I was very adverse to religion wasn't into it. And I made fun of it. My grandmother always told me about you know, yeah, there's a Creator you should do the right thing. It was basic, you know golden rules sure that she would instill in me. I saw the movie Malcolm X when I was already really really just kind of coming out of my jacked-up face and I saw that he
8:  It makes sense and is at that moment that I saw to look at these books that he gave me and the first the first book I read was Malcolm X right the autobiography. So I read because before that we was reading like Donald goines and Iceberg Slim was re no other show. So now I'm like, let me read some real shit. So I read Malcolm X and then second book. I read was a people's history by Howard Zinn right was talked about Columbus and all that shit and shit blew my mind. I was like this motherfucker was a criminal. Yeah.  Right. I'm in here and I'm here is my fucking slow to the whole nation of people and so and then from there was like black economics are conspiracy to destroy black boys volume is 1 2 and 3 and these are the books that he gave us. So now my mom was open. I'm like, oh shit. This shit is real and and it is at that point that I start to realize what happened to us how we got Bamboozled and how the system did his dirty and is at the point that I say. I'm a different man, right?
9:  The fuck out of it you sound crazy but during that course right at that time that movie American Me came out. Yes, right and they couldn't show that in the jail. Right? But because we was college program. He showed it to us and I'm like, what the fuck? What the fuck are you watching this? Like this is some crazy shit, right and he and then he goes into explaining like the cycle, you know some saying of how you know, the Mexican gangs and how it's hard to get off that the revolving door of prison and I'm like damn  It makes sense and is at that moment that I saw to look at these books that he gave me and the first the first book I read was Malcolm X right the autobiography. So I read because before that we was reading like Donald goines and Iceberg Slim was re no other show. So now I'm like, let me read some real shit. So I read Malcolm X and then second book. I read was a people's history by Howard Zinn right was talked about Columbus and all that shit and shit blew my mind. I was like this motherfucker was a criminal. Yeah.
 
Topic 56 gaslighting: On Twitter I saw someone reference a podcast interview with a doctor about gaslighting within organizational systems and I would like to hear it.
0:  We post it up on the Instagram and those will follow that was just asking me like, why did we ask the girl what her intention was and we she would like to see that that girl added into the conversation and I was just like I saw the because obviously like I don't she didn't realize that like I saw it from Twitter and I saw it literally unfold like on Twitter and I go got so much hate and I sold like am I saw the intention? I was like I  I saw it I understood it, but and I'm not hating on the girl. I just said that it's the opinion itself that made me really upset me that very clear and lost time and I continue I continue to make it clear and she just felt like I was like it was pointless. So anyway, I didn't think it was pointless. I wasn't being a hater. I was really just talking about that as a discussion just to say look, like people are still thinking like that and we need to continue.
1:  Invalidating yet until we bring all these all these people. I mean then the like the concept of privilege was brought up and you knowing so my all of us are privileged even I just waited this last week, but let's hold that because I won the special guest to come. Yeah, we need another episode but yes, I thought like it was invalidating everyone that all the other brand men in all the other industries that were really working hard to make a name for Pacific Islanders and  We post it up on the Instagram and those will follow that was just asking me like, why did we ask the girl what her intention was and we she would like to see that that girl added into the conversation and I was just like I saw the because obviously like I don't she didn't realize that like I saw it from Twitter and I saw it literally unfold like on Twitter and I go got so much hate and I sold like am I saw the intention? I was like I
2:  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's
3:  Yeah, so that's what I believe C being and being a part of technical communities or being active in such extracurricular activities helps you develop your communication skills a lot. Also your personality gets developed you get to meet new people, you know you adapt they are positivity is and things like that. So I think that that helps you a lot also being a part of these many communities, you know, boost your resume being a part of like a quality internships I say booster is you may again so I think it's not just a game of DSA.  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a
4:  But being hot is like the lowest on the totem pole Lee. I would rather be all the other things that I am than be attractive. Also. I love that. You're like, I'm going to start a podcast. That's how hot I am. I don't even need Title and seen have a hot boy what a people like have you gotten any weird reactions to when people like hear your voice versus when they just like read your Twitter voice. Yeah. People are either like, oh my God your voice is so cute. I had a girl tell me she thought I was British the entire time. She was following me. I'm like in what? How did those come from?  Witty, thank you, but like you're like, oh you thought I was highbrow think I sounded like a bond villain and that's the tea like no that was your fish. That wasn't shut up. You're just like tea. Hey, well, that's a hard word to say no British accent. I'm trying to imitate Sophie Turner. Oh, but I'm just a girl like, you know, like what kind of negative feedback have you gone about my voice? Yeah, like chirpy Woodland creature like like
5:  Things like that. And so that was like very fascinating any other that's why I chose Del again. That's great to hear some of that. So now a little bit boring part might start because we are going to discuss the exact things that happen in the technical interview. So em, it's the most informative part as well. So I would like to tell whoever is listening to this podcast just pay attention from now on if you weren't so this this is the this is the most important part so I see people thinking  King of interviews just a game of data structures and algorithms and some other core subjects how far some of the do you think that it is true. Do you think that being into extracurricular activities technical communities and all help you interviews or do you think it's just the subjects that you studied in college helped?
6:  At that point a hundred percent relatable to this and especially for me because I edit the podcast I Stumble over my words probably like three to four times in each episode and after afterwards I go through and I'm like finding the places in the in the audio to try to fix and like a certain point just like what am I doing man? What why do I why am I even bothering with this right now? It's not like they're going to like hear me stumbling over my words turn the episode.  It off and just like hats it. Well on you just look at this guy. Look at this planet or something. Look at this system hitting just start flipping tables dammit key. You ruined my entire afternoon, but in real in like realistically they're probably just like Get Right by it. They think about it one time and then that happened and then they just back into the episode. You know, they might just chuckling keep going like that sigh. Well, like it's it's not as important to them unless they're just sitting there typing.
7:  Media when you're cast as a woman, you're either cast is like the hot girlfriend. Yeah, the fat funny best friend who's not as pretty as amazing growth. God forbid. The best friend is prettier because then she'll take the spotlight. Yes, and then, you know, there's the mean girl and like men aren't cast that way. No way men. I mean, yeah, there's always like the ugly funny best friend. But yeah, but they still have so many nuances to them. And I think it's important for more women to realize like being hot actually just helps you with all the other shit.  But being hot is like the lowest on the totem pole Lee. I would rather be all the other things that I am than be attractive. Also. I love that. You're like, I'm going to start a podcast. That's how hot I am. I don't even need Title and seen have a hot boy what a people like have you gotten any weird reactions to when people like hear your voice versus when they just like read your Twitter voice. Yeah. People are either like, oh my God your voice is so cute. I had a girl tell me she thought I was British the entire time. She was following me. I'm like in what? How did those come from?
8:  Right and normally to someone who would have like social anxiety. That would like be it like Dad be that'd be like one of the moments where they're like, I can't do this like I'm getting awkward now, right but I gotta keep rolling with it because to me I couldn't say the word sure whatever my tongue slipped it be like that. Sometimes it be your own but like from a main movie standpoint, that would be like detrimental. But since I'm not a main character chances are Joey did not give a shit that it has as a steal. He's dealing with his own things in his own movie cuz I'm just a side character.  At that point a hundred percent relatable to this and especially for me because I edit the podcast I Stumble over my words probably like three to four times in each episode and after afterwards I go through and I'm like finding the places in the in the audio to try to fix and like a certain point just like what am I doing man? What why do I why am I even bothering with this right now? It's not like they're going to like hear me stumbling over my words turn the episode.
9:  On your podcast I was like, okay, I'll do some research on her. She's killing it on Twitter and I love Twitter. I think I know you're a better deal of Twitter. You're like I've seen your Instagram. I love Twitter because it's like not just people's assholes. Yeah and your face and like you're hot like you can do thirst traps all day, but you actually have a you're like I fully do but then you have Twitter. We don't even use your pretty blue sparkly eyes. The people tell me all the time. They're like, well you  Didn't do well on Twitter if you weren't like attractive, I'm like that's just simply incorrect because no that's just I like 100% not true because I could change my picture to a picture of like easy mac. And I would still do great because I'm funny. Like I'm that sounds like it's a good dick thing to say also like when I see your tweets, I can hear it from your voice. You've created such a unique voice that yeah still like Millennial young woman, but it's Elliot like me. Yeah, and I think there's so many people who are trying to compete with like what being the funny voice and

I co-founded which makes this podcast that you're listening to right now and many others you might remember homecoming began its life as a gimlet podcast and gimlet was very involved in the making of that show. In fact, I did a whole series of Stories on turning the homecoming podcast into the homecoming TV show.  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.

So my experience is limited, but the fact that she and I hit it off so quickly so early is practically unheard of I mean, the first thing we do is like oh, yeah, we all know each other's names.
3:  Are we don't tend to agree? Well, when I went to see her show at Shepherds Bush Empire. It was like untenable e hysterical like how old was the average audience member like one? I'm joking, but like young like so yeah as in parents were taking their chilled as an it was me and the parents and then like children on their shoulder like on the dad's shoulders really I and you couldn't hear Billy before because they just knew every word and they were screaming it but  Nice, I mean Billy. I really want to see her alive, but I just thought she put she said before she performs like a fan. Okay, so she jumps around loose a bit like Travis Scott thing as well. You know, I mean, yeah, I know what you mean, but I do feel sorry for her because she has had quite a like a tough time with like realizing which friends you could try she said recently in an interview that like she used to be so popular and you have so many friends and over the last year.

It's a huge loss for I think for the community especially because least in my world I grew up with that. Yes, I grew up.
