I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened. I'm gonna go touch with Jen tell him what happened you pretend you're the random rancid polisher.  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it.

So the difference between the molar report which was going on for the last three or four years when they're trying to take him down and the difference between this is they actually got a taped conversation or they got some some messages.

All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?  I need you know, how how do I do this? Because I had no clue. So what I got from my research was that we needed a good set of microphones. They told me that audio is important. They meaning Google and all the YouTube tutorials on podcasting what I got from it was that audio was important considering that a hundred percent of the time you're going to be listening to our voices.

I've had so many people who started listening to getting there. Like wow, your quality is improved. You sound so much more confident, you know, even though I have the same microphone that I have. Yeah, it's just like, you know, it's cool to see that progression and you don't need to be perfect from the beginning and that's  Something something that holds a lot of people back like I have a couple people that are friends or clients are like I've been wanting to start a podcast but XYZ excuse and I'm like, okay but like you can start and then you get better over time and then people are like wow, that's cool. I mean obviously you can't have like the crappy as audio quality because no one's going to listen. Yeah. No just start start where you can you don't need to splurge and buy the most expensive equipment from the get-go. If you don't if you can't afford it or don't want to afford it.

Where do you start? You know again, do you start the podcast again or do you start on Instagram or where you go? What would you do?  Yeah, I would definitely I would definitely start the podcast again. I don't know if in this in this world I had I still have all my connections. But if I do on it, I don't think it would be too tricky at all to get a podcast back up and running and honestly, like it's so easy to build out other platforms. Once you have a podcast because then you can start leveraging other people's platforms. It's so important like when you have a podcast and like I interviewed so many today who had like a million and a half followers on Instagram and he reposted my story and his story."

Not really there weren't really shy but anybody the podcasting space in particular that I was really looking up to when I was figuring out how to structure my show as far as like the different segments and stuff. I went through and listen to a bunch of different peoples podcasts and really just took notes on like how they structure their show. Do they ask the same questions every time.  Time do they what do they do differently? Like how does their intro sound like what about music? So yeah when I was going through I definitely did that it a lot of research but there was never really any anybody in particular that I listen to very frequently or like that. I really look up to in the space. I definitely take a little bit from everywhere the the one podcast that I will listen to like every episode of is he had my let show I really like what he's doing with his podcast.

I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that.

But because I have worked in comedy for 25 years. I can probably speak best about my own profession.  Way back in the 1940s. There was a very very funny man named Jack Benny. He was a giant star easily. One of the greatest comedians of his generation and a much younger man named Johnny Carson wanted very much to be Jack Benny in some way. He's in some ways. He was but in many ways he wasn't he emulated Jack Benny, but his own quirks and mannerisms along with the changing medium pulled him in a different direction."

We really should break down the some of the news that's come out today. Apparently the Giants are sending an MRI of Evan engram foot to dr. Robert Anderson. Who's one of the foremost foot specialists in the country. We have no update on that right now, but it does appear that the Giants are concerned about Evan engrams foot injury. Which would I mean look, he's a top  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening."

So that's the kind of tight end. I think they should bring in veteran short-term inexpensive who can block so you don't see a to tight end system with Jimmy Graham and Jared Cook at all. I don't I think it's too expensive 20 million to the tight end position is a lot. All right and Maggie, what do you think? Just should they go after cook it? What do you see the  Workers doing there Paul and I agree on everything today and it's not fun. I think I wholeheartedly agree. I would like to see the Packers address the tight end position maybe in the with the 44th pick in the second round. I think my preference would be to see them go edge o line or maybe Edge even with the the first round, but I also definitely agree that there needs to be a veteran in the lineup and I broke down the tight end."

All right. So let's move on to signing players. I know it's weird for us here in Packer land to actually think about being active in free agency. It's not something that we are really, you know used to under the Ted Thompson regime. It was all about drafting develop goodykoontz.  To want to be very active in free agency. It's so I want to get two things. I want to start with this tight end has been an area of concern for the Packers. You know, Jimmy Graham got he signed last year. That was the big-name free agent. The goons brought in didn't really live up to what every Packer fan kind of had hoped that he would live up to sounds like they're going to bring them back and you know, and but then the other thing"

And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years."

So that's intriguing me dude. I mean, it's like fun training yard football. But like the guy hasn't played tight end. I don't know intriguing it will see if it were a lot of fans. A lot of fans have been throwing up the let's turn on the gates Pat signal and bring them home, but I just didn't know I just don't know what what that does for us.  So if that makes us better, you know, well, it'd be nice to see Gates back just you know on a personal level, but I know that they have let's say they promoted tight end Steven Anderson to the squad and I overheard him. Yeah, me neither Matt. So Cole was a tight end coming to the practice squad and hate Kyle, who else is coming to the price? I remember something you said a couple weeks ago would be kind of fun.

It was a terrible experience. So on the way back he was like if you still want to stop at the thrift store, let's do that and I hadn't thrifted since we went to the beach, which I don't know if I told you guys about that I probably should tell you about that too. I digress.  And it was lit, I got so much good stuff. So I was glad we had worked out our little squabble though because every song that was playing in the thrift store was like one of the saddest country songs. I may have ever heard every single one. It was kind of hilarious. So I'm listening to sad country songs and sorting through the most amazing Thrift some of the finds that I wanted to tell you guys about was I got for Vintage House dresses."
