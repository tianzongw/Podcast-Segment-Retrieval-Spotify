Topic 1 coronavirus spread: What were people saying about the spread of the novel coronavirus NCOV-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019?
0: It started.  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.
1:  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.
2:  Alice's of the situation as well as the I guess impact on the economy because of course that's where my mind often times goes. So quick recap. This is a novel virus.  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.
3:  Is past whatever the flu kills, you know hundreds of thousands each year. I think they're really important thing to understand about that is that those hundreds of thousands? I mean you have the flu does kill them however the flu as far as we know based on current evidence and whatnot is less contagious or at least I should say has a lower are not number meaning. It's it's not spread as easily.  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%
4:  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.  In China and thus far it it, you know, it produces.
5:  but get into today's topic, you know, I almost hesitate to throw it another podcast about this this Wuhan this Chinese coronavirus and yet I mean I on this Friday  How can I do anything about that because it really is what is driving the markets today. It's driving a lot of these headlines me. If you turn on the Nightly News, if you turn on most mainstream news programs during the day, if you go over to 0 head, you know, most of the news cycle both financial and non-financial really is is fixated on this this coronavirus. So quick recap on where we're at right now, officially.
6:  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.  And it's a relative of SARS the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was was a big deal back in the early 2000s. Also close relative of Words, which is similar to SARS. But Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome and very similar symptoms and whatnot. And the same is true for Coronavirus. Now that the mortality rate the deadliness of this new coronavirus. It's still up in the air. And again, we'll be talking more about those numbers a little bit later on today's episode.
7:  Hon, but also some surrounding cities in the cash. I don't remember the name of the province hoobae. He hey some big cities right will haunt itself is roughly 11 million individuals. And this has spread to a ton of other countries around the world including Japan South Korea Thailand Australia. I think there's a potential reported case and France Russia the UK.  I believe and of course the United States we have soon to be three potentially three confirmed cases of this coronavirus here in the United States mostly from people that recently traveled to China usually the Wuhan providence province. And of course, this is a coming up on the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is is a big event for people traveling and whatnot. So certainly not a good time for this virus to be on the move.
8:  Based on his career trajectory. This is not just going to go away anytime soon. Right? I've learned a lot lately and I'm sure many other people have about this this are not of this coronavirus relative to past outbreaks and relative to other infectious diseases. They are not basically is this average number spread out over an entire population and it changes and it's different likely from population to population.  Stand on the point in time and their circumstances Etc.
9:  The room of the Chinese government how much have they downplayed this through manipulating these numbers? They taken a strong stance against that publicly but there's a thousand one reasons economically speaking socially speaking for them to say yeah. This is a not a big deal, right and also to to back that up with with numbers that are not out of this world. Now another thing that I found really interesting was was what they call the are not of this coronavirus are not is a measure of the  The spread of a pathogen essentially what it is is on average how many people will be infected by every person that is infected how many people will they spread it to? Right? So if it's one that means one person's present to one other person to another person right and that's just the overall the total number of infectors can stay steady below one is eventually it's going to die out on its own all else being equal and anything above 1 means that it's going to slowly be expanding and early on especially with these
 
Topic 2 greta thunberg cross atlantic: What were people saying about Greta Thunbergâ€™s sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the fall of 2019 and its relationship to global climate change?
0:  Miles of islands like it's two days sailing away. It's some of the deep, you know, some of the deepest ocean the Atlantic and there you are. There's human beings crash. That's how you'd also see big troll marks from panting. No.  He's back.
1:  So they were cutting class to go and stand in front of city hall or the capital and they're still doing it and that's what Greta started a year ago. And now she's up for a Nobel Peace Prize on mainstream news. It's hard to find Greta. Yeah, that's true more news. She's getting more news coverage than any environmental list on the planet, but it's hard to find her in mainstream news. Is that because it's it's seen as  I read an article I think was in the Atlantic about there was that climate report that came out and was maybe like six months to a year ago. That was just so sobering and it was this kind of art. It was the article was actually about that. It's so sobering that it's almost paralyzing and I think that yeah, I think that with the New Media thing the media wants to give you headlines that make you click right and it's going
2:  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.  Because with warm water in the atmosphere is damper, that's all drawn up so that you not only get greater wind speeds. But lot more water is poured down on communities when it comes down and it would have been the past. I'm not sure where the original question was here. But I don't know either keep going. Well Greta to finger good. She's saying that that we need to panic about it because the situation is that bad and even if say we were wrong
3:  Way Beyond their scholarship and the cost of attendance but it's a tough tough issue and if sponsors won't pay big commercial dollars for women's soccer game on TV those women aren't likely to get paid a lot of money for playing soccer before your second trip you met what now is your husband and you got engaged to him in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean while he was back home. Did they engagement inspire you to get home quicker? Yes.  Yes, I asked him if you would marry me he had this romantic response. He said sure why not and from that point on I pretty much wrote around the clock till I get home December 3rd 1999. You completed your journey across the Atlantic at what point? Did you realize this trip was going to be a success? Yeah, probably December first when I saw Guadalupe for the first time in the middle of the ocean because at any point before that, you can always make a mistake that ends it or ends you
4:  Ooh were fighting climate change is there it exists we have all of the tools in front of us. It's just a matter of acting like this. That's a great idea but like make it so that every new building that's built is NetZero. Like that would be amazing. Another thing that done. I don't know. It's a strange still giant, you know that and subdivision. I'll tell you why it isn't done and this relates to some of the questions you sent me. What what we can do is in relates back to Extinction rebellion, and Greta is  People have to speak up and not just to friends and family and stuff like that. They have to speak out and speak up and show up. Just imagine next Friday right have the second part of the global climate strike on this. Yes on the 27th of Millennium Park 12 to 3, but matching of thousands of people showed up for that rather than I mean probably a few hundred will come and hoping in the Thousand. Yeah, let's get a thousand but I'm saying imagine if that
5:  So yes, we were I can't remember which one it was. But we were basically mapping coral reefs. So like they had been to that study site before and they had you know, these beautiful videos of this pristine reefs and then we'd gone back and then this time there was like giant black bin bags of fishing mesh that has been dumped my do it rocks in them. There was footballs Coca-Cola cans and and this is like 250 nautical.  Miles of islands like it's two days sailing away. It's some of the deep, you know, some of the deepest ocean the Atlantic and there you are. There's human beings crash. That's how you'd also see big troll marks from panting. No.
6:  And then the sponsors had no, no, no, we're gonna sponsor a French woman to row the Mid-Atlantic route. We want you the American to row from the United States to France going west to east across the North Atlantic. I'm like, I'm crazy, but I'm not that crazy turned out I was so there I was alone on the North Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat and I lost Communications eight days from the start and it's really important. If you're going to try to row the North Atlantic to be able to track the Gulf Stream.  Men stay in the Gulf Stream, which is a warm water current that pushes his way toward France. It's one of the things that give southern France its temperate climate is the warm water current that you know sweeps that direction and if you can stay in the Gulf Stream the North Atlantic route can be very fast. When I lost Communications the boat got pushed north of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is very predictable close to the shore of the United States, but when it goes out toward the middle of the ocean, it's a little like a fire hose it can you can you know, go a hundred miles north
7:  Less individualistic to more kind of collective future. I just I just wondered when you said you weren't sure about Extinction Reveille news. Was it because it wasn't sort of personified by a single Angelic individual that seemed amazing. Whereas Greta obviously is you know that Li you can relate more to her because because she's a amazing young woman it is it just it feels like  Her story and what she's done? I guess it's like she's come. So from nowhere. He couldn't have designed for a Greta to arrive and like immobilized the climate crisis movement as well as I might I find that more compelling rather than it's just because she's an it is not because she's an individual individual is just like that's the kind of change all these all of us including me that are trying to do like designing change.
8:  Disaster on a massive scale even more frightening is the possibility of misuse of biotechnology in creating dangerous and resilient diseases pests and weeds. This could be done deliberately as a means of bioterrorism or accidentally by some overzealous. Idiot in a lab coat if disaster movies have taught us anything number three Gulf Stream shut down. The Gulf Stream is a huge global current which carries warm water Northwest across the Atlantic Ocean warming Western and Northern Europe. However, global  Warming is causing problems for this by Heating and melting ice caps into the Gulf Stream Global Warming. Ironically slows it down and there is evidence that if the trend continues it could eventually totally stop as well as making Europe even colder and greater than it already is this could result in disasters ranging from huge climate changes including massive storms to a mass phytoplankton Extinction. You may recognize phytoplankton as the things which everything else eats did I mention that Europe was cold enough already number two.
9:  Over 30% of our economy is fine and is now Financial products though. He said yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, which is insane. Yeah, and it's no wonder that we can't figure out how to rewire this thing. Right? Yeah. So a mortgage strike would be a real thing not a made-up thing and it would change our culture in profound ways and the way we think about what has value  And why things have value and what we really want from our lives and how we want to go to work and what we want to work for right? Also Greta is landing on the East Coast by boat my gosh her trip is amazing but her commitment to not flying and being at these un climate talks where she's going to be he most honoured guests in the world. It's pretty inspiring.
 
Topic 3 black hole image: In May 2019 astronomers released the first-ever picture of a black hole.  I would like to hear some conversations and educational discussion about the science of astronomy, black holes, and of the picture itself.
0:  Wow, which brings up a crazy point that I thought about so you always hear about how the universe is like infinitely expanding. Yeah, you always hear that like you've written for me like like all the time Interstellar. It's the best space movie. It's not even just this best space movie. It's the best movie ever.  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if
1:  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.  home, I guess I thought then Interstellar Dome into
2:  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if  You fall into a black hole. But how do you even know how that even come along? Do you where does it go? Okay.
3:  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.
4:  Zero impact to what we do each day. Like it doesn't matter weird. I think it's it is without question is horrible philosophically. Bullet philosophical Phyllis are yeah, I don't me wrong. It's an interesting Trend thought but the fact that it will never matter to us. Yes is the answer and if I just move my everyday routine people are getting I'm just saying like if  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.
5:  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.  Here's how they proved that looks like scientists have actually proved that it's realistic fiction. Jake crazy, like accurate nuclear their time clocks meaning. It's just like a stopwatch but down to like a trillionth of a second and like they put one on the floor and they put one like on a hundred foot platform. And the closer you are to Earth. Obviously the gravity's heavier because like when she get higher gravity gets lighter,
6:  No, everything is based in science up till the very end. Then he dives into a loophole theories. Yes, but it's only like it's a very small part of the movie up till that everything in the show is scientifically combatable meaning like okay, here's an example and one part they go to a planet and this planet is in the process of being sucked into a black hole, but it's far enough away where they can get onto it and get off. Now. The thing won't one thing they really dive into is the  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that
7:  This is what intent originally was to to do this to society. Like it was just not look at this picture and you can put like I used to I never used to think that you could people could actually see your picture. So so upload the same picture with all the different edits. Did you actually like? Oh, I know people actually would you do this? What are you doing? I think I'm delayed them. Now that I'm a picture of a tree and then I just like upload 10 of them in different and they feel like the filters of what filters that hole.  A woman getting like you know how I felt as a start of like, oh, this one looks black and white and this one looks kind of tired and now it's like let this filter that changes your whole face. Yeah, like oh my gosh, my nose isn't never look smaller. Love you. Thank you so much Snapchat Instagram. So do you think it's affected your mental health at all? Oh, yeah. I got you're wise enough to have written above it before when I was younger and a bit more like moldable and impregnable definitely like definitely affected me because I think I'd never been super like not confident in who I am as a person but physically
8:  Basically, so I don't know much about Interstellar from but what from what you talk about it. It's basically a movie based on theories. Is that correct?  No, everything is based in science up till the very end. Then he dives into a loophole theories. Yes, but it's only like it's a very small part of the movie up till that everything in the show is scientifically combatable meaning like okay, here's an example and one part they go to a planet and this planet is in the process of being sucked into a black hole, but it's far enough away where they can get onto it and get off. Now. The thing won't one thing they really dive into is the
9:  Then we have an instance where life arose in two different places in the same solar system independent of each other. Then I will buy your statistical argument life is probably everywhere. But until then I'm leaving open the possibility that it's nowhere else but here why because improbable things happen. This universe is improbable. All physicists will agree to that astronomers are  Buddy, I talk to you and I talk to a lot agree that the universe is improbable. Why is there something rather than nothing is a question that's very hard to answer right now. We don't have a good one and other things like singularities like black holes and most particularly the Big Bang Singularity is a big problem for physics right now. They have to come up with well, what caused the big bang and so these issues are all being read?
 
Topic 4 story about riding a bird: I remember hearing a podcast that had a story about a kid riding some kind of bird.  I want to find it again.
0:  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.  It's the same for the Ducks. I mean, he's divers are flying a foot two feet off the water. And yep. That's a really good point. Yep, you know as far as a lot of people ask me they say I can't believe you would throw a bright white 5 gallon bucket or 25 or 35 gallon barrel into your boat as a decoy. Well a lot of these birds
1: Hello there. My name is Danny Yeoman while bird expert for pets corner and developer of Peter and Paul Byrd Foods. Welcome to the first of a number of podcast detailing some of the amazing birds that we see him feeding our garden each month. We'll be looking at different bird and I thought I'd start off with the nation's favourite bird the wonderful Robin on a misty winter morning. My garden is usually quiet apart that is for the song of one of their communist.  First and most familiar Birds the robin. It's a sound I am used to hearing for unlike virtually every other British bird Robbins held territories and sing more or less all year round.
2:  Lot of new Hunters those got the careful use the flag to get the birds attention. I had to take Flags away from a lot of my homes and layouts because they wanted to flag the Berks right on past the decoys. So there gets to be a point when he done put the flag down and start shooting at them too. But movement in being seen can really help out a hunter and you'd like I said, you don't necessarily have to have the most expensive decoys on the market.  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.
3:  Pot into the sink or knocking something over whatever it was. It made a clatter. I whipped my head around to look at her in the source of the noise, and it completely spooked her. She had never seen me react to any type of noise or sound before I obviously don't remember any of this as I was a toddler, but I heard the story many times.  My daughter was very hard of hearing due to glue ear when she was 4 she had grommets place to drain the fluid. She woke me up at sunrise the morning after the operation because she could hear the birds outside. It was a Bittersweet moment for me. As I was pleased to see the look of Joy on her face, but greatly saddened that I hadn't realized how bad her hearing had been for her whole life so far. She also come to realize she hates ambulances and Loud motorbikes.
4: Welcome back to Story Time with Kayla Jane and her mother in the wild. Today. We're going to be reading a very fun book together called brown bear brown bear. What do you see by Bill Martin? Jr. Are you ready? Okay cozy.  Brown bear brown bear. What do you see? I see a red bird looking at me red bird red bird. What do you see? I see a yellow duck looking at me.
5:  First and most familiar Birds the robin. It's a sound I am used to hearing for unlike virtually every other British bird Robbins held territories and sing more or less all year round.  That's not the only surprising thing about the robin common and familiar this little bird. Maybe it still has the capacity to surprise us. They are proof then one birds for you at least Britain's gardeners are pigs centuries ago. When wild boar freely roam the nation's Countryside. It's frequent companion was the little Robin
6:  My aunt didn't know that rain was so loud.  I was so confused. The first time I heard the rain pattering on the roof or the sound of carpet when you move your foot. Oh and love to hearing Tui birds singing outside. My mom got hearing aids when she was in her 20s, and she said the first thing she heard when she left the hospital was birds singing she heard it on TV, but thought they made it louder for effect.
7:  First time you're unfamiliar wait for the podcast. We're not doing we're not doing wet Spider-Man weekly. We cannot do what Spider-Man it's not a it's not in the cards. It's not even like a little like just 30 seconds maybe nowhere spiders, but none of it. This is the Angry Birds podcast. They look I'm here to hear about the Angry Birds and have a drink piss which I gotta say. They definitely do drink piss. Yeah, that's that's a big agree from me as well. I'm so glad is and now that we've got out of the way maybe  Yeah, if you're new to the Pug asking you are unfamiliar with the concept of angry was drinking person Angry Birds movie all together. You can check this out on YouTube. It's really their type in Angry Birds piss in the movie The Angry Birds drink piss. I still get messages from people haven't done 50 episodes. They really don't drink pissed. Yeah, they fucking drink piss. Well, why would I what would I make 50 episodes of this of they didn't drink any purse I've been sewing to do that. Yeah that there's no ambiguity in the title of the podcast. It's called The Angry Birds do drink pee.
8:  If you're like, oh wow, this is the most depressing pain guys have made it this long and the episode. Yeah, if you've made it this long and then it's going to get a little bit. It's gonna be a little happier. So she's doing some other hand. I'm not sure what this is means Pappy fire going up in the air. I don't know. It's like a bird. It's your bird hand Pepe. It's like pepper a little bird. Oh, yeah. That's okay guys. Alright, let's end this. Okay go live the Epic life and Inspire someone with your story will see you guys in episode 6 next  Yeah, pull through by guys, please.
9:  My daughter was very hard of hearing due to glue ear when she was 4 she had grommets place to drain the fluid. She woke me up at sunrise the morning after the operation because she could hear the birds outside. It was a Bittersweet moment for me. As I was pleased to see the look of Joy on her face, but greatly saddened that I hadn't realized how bad her hearing had been for her whole life so far. She also come to realize she hates ambulances and Loud motorbikes.  Oh, I have a great story friend's sister was very hard of hearing nearly deaf. She got Cochlear implants at work. I was asked to help her pair her implants with her new phone because they're freaking Bluetooth while I'm doing this. She is happily telling me how sensitive they are. I can hear paper. She had no idea paper sliding on paper made a noise. She then told me she could hear her hand sliding on the wall, and how cats annoyed her.
 
Topic 5 daniel ek interview: Someone told me about a podcast interview with Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, about the founding and early days of Spotify.  I would like to find the show and episode that contains that interview.  Other interviews with Ek are relevant as well.
0:  I forgot I had told you I'm 16. Oh Arthur and love you finding a podcast. I really appreciate the hospitality. Cool. Thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. Right I'll take the key ate it and that's going to be it for the interview. I really appreciate you listening to the major jobs podcast. This one was a really great interview because it was something that was a unique job. It was a CEO but not really a CEO just like a founder of his own business and he was on Shark Tank. So it was really interesting.  To hear about what it was like starting a business and running it, and I'd really like to thank Max for doing this. I really appreciate his insight into what it's like being a founder of a business. And other than that, I really hope you enjoyed this. If you want you can subscribe to this podcast. I'm on Apple Spotify and all the major will podcasting networks. Anyways, thanks for listening, and I'll see you next week. Bye. Bye.
1:  Hello and welcome to start up. I'm Alex blumberg and we are at the third and final episode of startup ever. The last episode of the last season of the very first podcast gimlet ever launched. We're taking you inside the sale of gimlet to the streaming giant Spotify. Just a quick note here at the top. There is some swearing in this episode.  Last episode Matt and I had just come back from a whirlwind trip to Stockholm right before Thanksgiving to meet with Daniel Eck the CEO of spotify and although no one had officially told us this that trip had the feel of a final hurdle before Spotify made an official offer to buy us. And so you might be wondering what's it like to go to Thanksgiving with your entire family your aunts and uncles and cousins in the house where you grew up and your parents still live after just returning from a 22 hour round trip Excursion to Sweden where you may or may not
2:  trying to go with it. Does that make sense? Yeah, I see. Well, thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. It really like took me into like the mind of an entrepreneur. And also if you wouldn't mind can you tell me your reaction your professors and your classmates reaction to you when you get back from winter break because I kind of want to hear hundred. I'll make sure you don't worry. I appreciate it. Yeah. All right, by the way, how proud.  I forgot I had told you I'm 16. Oh Arthur and love you finding a podcast. I really appreciate the hospitality. Cool. Thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. Right I'll take the key ate it and that's going to be it for the interview. I really appreciate you listening to the major jobs podcast. This one was a really great interview because it was something that was a unique job. It was a CEO but not really a CEO just like a founder of his own business and he was on Shark Tank. So it was really interesting.
3:  In two days. Yeah, you completely fine. But I think four days ago, you would like terrified. Yeah, so I just think like, how are you okay with it now and then you just go ahead and do it. Like there's nothing wrong in it, but you were really stressed and unstressed and like obviously I think for most people how it works is when you first find out you've got something like an interview the nerves and the anxiety build as you get closer to. Yeah, but you you kind of get like once, you know, you've got the interview you kind of get the nerves and anxiety the day You've Been Told  To get the interview and it's at the same level as if you're having that interview then yeah the time you heard about it, but then it kind of just Peters out the closer you get to it because you can't maintain that intensity of feeling I guess for that long because I mean physically yeah would be horrible to continually feel like a certain way about it all the way up to when it happens. Yeah, so I it's interesting with me. I have a huge delay, which is so same same example. Yeah job interview. I could try.
4:  Have consistently get an episode up whether it's both of us. One of us. I think that's very difficult to do and we managed to do it pretty much every week for an entire year. So that was a goal that I kind of set out we both kind of set out early on so we accomplished that and then the other part of it was to just kind of like try different things like our episodes. I totally get in 2019 at times are a little all over the place some people like that. Some of them are interviews. Some of them are getting really into the Weeds on like, you know, the ux design process and the thing is, is that there really  And over like the trend is overall Trends where that people like the interviews no surprise there but people did really like getting deep dives into specific topics. Like the recent episode on user flows had a ton of people listening and commenting on there is episodes on the overall overarching ux design process that episode perform really well. So we're so going to be experimenting with topics. I think the one thing that I hope that we can do is also expand design huddle not just as a ux or podcast or a product manager podcast or
5:  Say what I wanted to say and I'm like, well, I'm so sorry, but I'm very brutal in these situations like you've had an hour and you told me way too much about this thing. Yeah, I did. That's not that relevant to what you'll be doing with me. Yeah, and I have to say like it sucks when people watch an interview for sure. I feel bad for them. But also I need someone who's going to deliver exactly when they say they're going to leave out. You know what I mean? Like if I send someone  Into a pitch. I want them to pitch at that time. They're not going to have a second chance. Totally. Yeah, so would be interesting. I mean obviously hiring for different positions you're going to get different styles of people and different, you know, people not everyone's going to be really super strong and interviews so actually being a good interviewer. It's very important as well. Yeah, and I think a lot of a lot of the modern thinking around interviews is like ignore stuff that seems good and look for what you actually want. So when you're
6:  You also have your own podcast, which I listen to all the time. Um, why don't you talk a little bit about that? So my podcast is called the real real and it's kind of like a play on words because the last real spelled r ee L like a highlight reel a reel of film. So what I thought when I was starting it was I want to start a podcast where I interview people and I didn't only want to interview super successful people. I didn't only want to  Interview like women I didn't only want to interview my friends. Like I wanted to interview a ton of people in different walks of life and I wanted it to be very very real sense the title but very much like not. Oh, how did you become super successful? I wanted it to be like, what are the real struggles of getting to where you are or you might not be where you want to be yet. But what are you doing to get there? Like I interview so many of my friends and different jobs that don't often get highlighted like my
7:  To get the interview and it's at the same level as if you're having that interview then yeah the time you heard about it, but then it kind of just Peters out the closer you get to it because you can't maintain that intensity of feeling I guess for that long because I mean physically yeah would be horrible to continually feel like a certain way about it all the way up to when it happens. Yeah, so I it's interesting with me. I have a huge delay, which is so same same example. Yeah job interview. I could try.  I've got a job interview in on Thursday. So like a week. I'm like, I've got a week I am fine every day every day. I'm fine even like the Wednesday. No problem. I think yeah, whatever job interview who cares and obviously my track record with interviews all hideous. I mean I've mentioned before I've never got a job from an interview and in the jobs where I had an interview and got the job is because I knew the person that was interviewing me and it wasn't a real interview but interviews with genuine strangers that have never met before I have never
8:  the winners of the podcast that's cheese for the hundredth time per episode. I love all the cheersing cool. So we have a really exciting resource of the week. We've decided in you know to stay on topic. Yeah with what we discussed in this episode. We are going to give you our favorite interview resources. Yeah. So those will include like a lot of no really great interview questions how to conduct them how to format them. It's going to be fabulous. Yeah, just download and keep it.  You're conducting into an interview. But also if you're like going to a new yeah, yeah should be a conversation for sure. I mean, like I know that when I do job interviews, I'm asking questions from the get-go. Yeah. I'm like, so how does this work? I saw on your website that you do this what happens? They're like, what? Why do you do that? And they're like, oh, well, this is why you know what? I mean, like just chat girls just to chat. Yeah, absolutely. So that's going to be really cool. You'll find that in the show notes.

0:  Like Goldman and Sachs and we'll just leave it. There we go. We'll just leave it there but show me you can we get into this mess? Aw. It's a bit controversial as hell. Michelle. Obama would not be famous if Obama.  Not become president disagree with you would be famous, but she would be successful. She would have a following the no definitely not but yeah, she's a lawyer she be successful, but she wouldn't have 50 million shape. She is what she is today because Obama became president. Yeah, Michelle Obama, you can say the same about most of the the only the only one I respect though is I don't respect from the windows wife. She skimmed off on him. No. No, but she helped build Amazon though. She took like she helped build Amazon.
1:  Hey y'all. Hey, welcome back to don't touch my nonsense today on our regularly programmed episode. We will be discussing the important life decisions of  Barack Obama Barack Obama and what he does with his wife in their own home? Not just white house anymore. Totally kidding. We're not going to be talking about Barack Obama or his wife Michelle Obama. We will be talking about gender roles and little of this a little of that. But before we get into that heavy-ass topic because Michelle is wrong just go ahead and start that out. Absolutely not. Yeah, she's wrong, but we'll get into how she's wrong and
2:  Barack Obama Barack Obama and what he does with his wife in their own home? Not just white house anymore. Totally kidding. We're not going to be talking about Barack Obama or his wife Michelle Obama. We will be talking about gender roles and little of this a little of that. But before we get into that heavy-ass topic because Michelle is wrong just go ahead and start that out. Absolutely not. Yeah, she's wrong, but we'll get into how she's wrong and  And why she's wrong. But first we're going to go ahead and talk about something that we can both agree on and this is kitkat's Kit Kats and how to eat them. So Michelle, can you explain how you and I eat a Kit Kat? All right. So this is a very very complex procedure scalpel, you know, Mask full scrubs required gloves and everything you you absolutely need this. It's you have to like scrubbing and everything before you can even open the Kit Kat wrapper. It's a very intense process.
3:  Beyonce or Michelle Obama because those were the two that you were very C very much about in the last episode of the podcast. So Madam Michelle is what we'll call her in this particular. Okay, Madam Michelle sure. She's a little taller than me. I'm at 5:10. She's like what six seven what how tall is she really? I don't think it's a good question. Damn Amazon. Wait, six seven woman.  She's just check it out. Look that up for me. Let's figure something it up. So while he's looking at all. Oh, she's the tall glass of chocolate. Milk. Michelle Obama using Siri is 5 feet 11 inches tall and you're 510. Yeah, I'm fine I bad so that's literally like eyeball to eyeball where we're there for a woman. That seems a little much where some Nikes relaxes you she puts on Heels. That's 6 feet. That's it. I'm having to find some cowboy boots. That's yeah. Well, like I said,
4:  Is Jim put out the word that they were good and they were not because of the photos and Jan is in the confessional like girl. Who are you? You're not Michelle Obama, you're not that important and I feel like gin definitely wanted support and showing that you know people were at her event. I don't necessarily feel like it had to be, you know, the ladies it could have been it could have been  In Celebrity, but I feel like because they were there it only makes sense to show the photos. So I don't know what was said along with the photos. I don't know if they just posted the photos if they posted a caption saying we having a great time together. I don't know what that was going on. But I mean it's only right for her to post the photos. It was her events. She wanted exposure. I don't think it was a PR stunt on her end. However, we don't know these ladies are sneaky their conniving some of them.
5:  You said what I said, you know, I'm not really into light-skinned man, but I think he actually is attractive. So how Chris is cute. Yeah.  All right, good, you'll turn okay I'm going to do okay. This one should make you have to thank mmm. I bet said Michelle Obama Barack Obama or Michael girl. They don't know I'm thinking about shit because I'm going stir it up a little since I was like four years old. So Michael you can get all of this mash and I'm sorry Obama Obama. I'm sorry.
6:  All right, good, you'll turn okay I'm going to do okay. This one should make you have to thank mmm. I bet said Michelle Obama Barack Obama or Michael girl. They don't know I'm thinking about shit because I'm going stir it up a little since I was like four years old. So Michael you can get all of this mash and I'm sorry Obama Obama. I'm sorry.  I got a rifle in my room. All right Obama, you heard it. He probably do, you know, they'd be listening to the phones and even text you. Okay, so it's my turn celebrities and for my celebrity Truth Hurts Liz. Oh pretty woman.
7:  Not become president disagree with you would be famous, but she would be successful. She would have a following the no definitely not but yeah, she's a lawyer she be successful, but she wouldn't have 50 million shape. She is what she is today because Obama became president. Yeah, Michelle Obama, you can say the same about most of the the only the only one I respect though is I don't respect from the windows wife. She skimmed off on him. No. No, but she helped build Amazon though. She took like she helped build Amazon.  60 billion, but she hoped she has cheated on her. I mean we did it.
8:  Off the girls. I should come up with a couple of dudes in a week. She's at home because they people around us. We just want them to be doing something in their life. Otherwise, they're just dragging you down. Yeah, like it's not just the girls. I mean, I don't think they're dragging you down unless you let them well, I got friends that I got friends that aren't really following a like, you know a good like they're not if I get into a relationship right now. I don't want my future to be the only future from both of us as I was saying because it has to work both ways. I mean like yeah, we each had to pull our weight. Yes, I'm saying pull your weight. I mean obviously  Like Goldman and Sachs and we'll just leave it. There we go. We'll just leave it there but show me you can we get into this mess? Aw. It's a bit controversial as hell. Michelle. Obama would not be famous if Obama.
9:  Sat down and had the chance to interview Jamie liner. She's a good friend of mine and colleague from work and wanted to talk to her a little bit more about her story and one of the highlights, I won't steal her Thunder before we dive in but she did things a little bit different than I did and that's really one of the cool things and one of the reasons I wanted to talk to her. Not just because she has Michelle Obama arms, but I will say if you take a look she definitely has better arms that Michelle Obama not creepy. It's  True. Anyways, I really wanted to bring Jamie on to talk to her more about the ways in which she navigated her life when she came to Charlotte. It's definitely a unique story and completely different and new and it was really exciting to sit down and talk to her talk to her. So without further Ado. Let's hear a little bit more from Jamie.
 
Topic 7 anna delvey: Anna Sorokina moved to New York City in 2013 and posed as wealthy German heiress Anna Delvey.  In 2019 she was convicted of grand larceny, theft, and fraud.  What were people saying about her, the charges, her trial, and New York socialite society in general?
0:  On September 21st 2001 Anna arrived at her office and started work as usual, but at 10:15 a.m. She got a call from a supervisor saying that there was a problem with one of her subordinates. He didn't have time to deal with it. So he needed Anna to come down to the office and take care of it for him. Anna readily complied when she reached the office. However, she didn't find a beleaguered colleague.  Said she found two members of Scott Carmichael's investigative team. She was under arrest like always Anna kept her cool. She claimed her right to remain silent and asked for legal counsel a female officer searched her and then the team led her out of the building in handcuffs. Anna was so quiet that most of her colleagues didn't even look up as she went by
1:  Eight putting an end to this risky detour in her career, or she could find a new objective there by re committing herself to a life of crime for some this might have been a tough decision. But Anna barely even hesitated. She knew the US had political objectives for Cuba and considered them a threat to the island sovereignty just like she had for Nicaragua Anna now dedicated her life to protect.  Ting the smaller country from its bullying Northern neighbor in 1992 35 year old Anna was accepted to a program that allowed her to study a project of her choice on the government's dime. She used it as an opportunity to travel legally to Cuba. She spent 12 months in the nation. She was secretly working for on the side in February of 1993 her new expertise earned her yet another
2:  Apart given these qualities and her past Behavior. It's not surprising that on a decided to stay. She later said she didn't want to give up on the people. She was helping but chances are she couldn't bear to think they might be. Alright without her.  On September 21st 2001 Anna arrived at her office and started work as usual, but at 10:15 a.m. She got a call from a supervisor saying that there was a problem with one of her subordinates. He didn't have time to deal with it. So he needed Anna to come down to the office and take care of it for him. Anna readily complied when she reached the office. However, she didn't find a beleaguered colleague.
3:  T the nation democratically elected a new president apparently without influence from the US. We don't know for sure if the information that on a provided helped bring about this long-awaited change, but we do know it brought the country's Civil War to an end leaving 33 year old Anna at a major crossroads her Mission as she knew it was now over and that meant she had a choice to make she could either go straight.  Eight putting an end to this risky detour in her career, or she could find a new objective there by re committing herself to a life of crime for some this might have been a tough decision. But Anna barely even hesitated. She knew the US had political objectives for Cuba and considered them a threat to the island sovereignty just like she had for Nicaragua Anna now dedicated her life to protect.
4:  Main producer of this podcast that you're listening to along with senior producer Brian Landers. She is a producer so I get to work with my dear friend and a partner on this labor of love that we call your first million and now I get to interview her I get to have her on the show. So we've already done the interview we did in Munich as I said and it's like super  Super low-key too. So she'd she's German. I mean, I'm just, you know, put that out there queer German girl on Twitter and Instagram. She's Jeremy. So she has this like a lot of Germans have this sort of really even Keel temperament and you don't really know like I'll just talk about Anna so I won't talk so broadly about Germans, but with Anna you don't really know if she's stoked about something and I've learned her her.
5:  History World War 2 with Ray Harris, jr. Sure and he interviews an author by the name of Robin Hutton about her book animals of War. So Story begins prior to World War Two. Yes. United States military did not have a dog program anything like we always think of like we see, you know, German Shepherds or Belgian Malinois sore, you know like Rottweilers. Yeah. Yep in the military. So yeah actually  Prior to that they didn't but shortly after Pearl Harbor the attack on Pearl Harbor December 7th, 1941 a poodle breeder and New York socialite was like her name was Arlene Erlanger. Thanks. Yeah, no to say so she got together with a bunch of her friends. And one of them was like a writer for the New York sun and a couple people in the American Kennel society and they formed this group called dogs for defense and they were like
6:  Super low-key too. So she'd she's German. I mean, I'm just, you know, put that out there queer German girl on Twitter and Instagram. She's Jeremy. So she has this like a lot of Germans have this sort of really even Keel temperament and you don't really know like I'll just talk about Anna so I won't talk so broadly about Germans, but with Anna you don't really know if she's stoked about something and I've learned her her.  Language her body language and her her expression, right? So she says something is good. It's great if she says something is okay. It's pretty good, you know, so she she gets excited or she laughs or something. It's like, oh boy, I've really struck struck gold so, you know listening and yes, I fangirl over her a little bit because she is adorable. What are you gonna do? But you really I mean, I love this one because we talked about we're not talking about
7:  All right, this is Anna. My name is Anna and Noah, and I'm a writer composer and actor.  Most of the time and Anna we're going to talk to you today in where are we aware and Munich or as we say me I can say it MÃ¼nchen you can mention mention. Yeah, very good. We are Muenchen Munich Germany Deutschland. Oh, yeah. Yeah exactly and we're talking to you today because you have reached an interesting Milestone on YouTube you have
8:  yes, she went on with Anna. I just didn't completely by that. He was really looking out for Anna's well-being because one of the couple's that's been in each strong. Yes. They've been in the bottom three is now disbanded that the back of my head. I was thinking you've never shown as far as we've seen this sort of loyalty to Anna and I really care I really care about that girl know there's some like and and if I have to hear him say you're talkin your jaw talking. She says it all.  I feel like we get it. You don't set book. Yeah, Curtis teachers are fucking no doubt. She deserves to give him that but I just didn't buy completely that what water was saying was culture and I've seen a line loads of people saying more is safe to show and we've both said that time she's been brilliant TV. She really has been brilliant but as the sort of squeaky bum time comes in and the checks are about to be written day that your seems a little bit of game played in my eyes. She's absolutely a game player. I'm going to put it right out.
9:  Of Injustice in the eyes of many this is exactly what makes Ana Montes such a dangerous criminal more than 15 years have passed since she was escorting to a federal prison, but Anna has yet to express remorse for betraying her country. She scheduled for release in 2023 as for what Anna will do with her Freedom only time and very close.  Servation will tell.
 
Topic 8 facebook stock prediction: After Facebookâ€™s Q4 2018 earnings call, what were expertsâ€™ predictions and expectations for its stock price in 2019?  How did these predictions fare over time?  Relevant material would include predictions immediately following the Jan 29, 2019, earnings call, and later actual stock performance that could be used to evaluate predictions.
0:  Learn and measuring it within his perception of outcomes. I think that's why I'm sorry. Sorry, I'll be after you. I was going to say my advice to a young investor would be get an investment Journal going right down your not only your predictions about like, oh, I think I'm going to make money here, but write down your predictions about the business itself and keep score for yourself. I think that's you have to close that feedback loop to  To really start learning about yourself about what you understand about how the world is when it throws you curveballs and what you can learn from them. You have to get the Reps in but I think you can learn much faster if you keep score and I unfortunately, I don't think that that's actually a common practice because it takes a little bit of work and it's annoying to do that. So start a blog do it publicly.
1:  I mean there's there's a lot of different ways that he sees the world as Google. So going off to ADT. Well, like they're doing all these home. Yeah, it doesn't actually well all of them are commonly. That's sort of the theory. I mean alarm.com is a cool company that sort of monitors a lot of your home stuff and then what else he'll take a swing on a biotech like that guy sees, I think he's very good in general at seeing risk and  Learn and measuring it within his perception of outcomes. I think that's why I'm sorry. Sorry, I'll be after you. I was going to say my advice to a young investor would be get an investment Journal going right down your not only your predictions about like, oh, I think I'm going to make money here, but write down your predictions about the business itself and keep score for yourself. I think that's you have to close that feedback loop to
2:  Another time so they were correct 70% They thought that they would be right 19 percent. So pretty good calibration there then they gave them any 10 piece of information. They want any 20 pieces all the way up to any 40 pieces of information that they wanted on these horses. And so what do you think happened? I know the answer to this story, but you would think that the more information they had the better their predictions got all right, right. So what?  Happened was the the performance plateaued at 17% But they're the belief that they thought they would be right skyrocketed all the way up to about like 36 or 38 percent and because of that they're betting heavier, and they actually had the worst performance with the with the additional information because of their confirmation bias that led to them getting heavier when they would have been able to make better decisions with less information.
3:  Does of course and how does that impact the stock to flow model and maybe your prediction so I did the analysis I implemented for different ways of adjusting for lost coins. The original way was to just ignore the first million coins so-called Satoshi coins. We don't know of course if those were still she coins, but that's that's the narrative and well those coins haven't moved. So so let's let's  do as if they are lost. So that's one approach then I did the no adjustment approach. So in leave those 1 million in there, I did a gradual loss scenario. So we're sort of about 4 million lost coins rattle around around now 2019. So that's about what is it 30-something percent.
4:  Great to get feedback and especially from guys like like juror who are in the space for almost from the beginning. So and that's also why I put everything on Twitter and GitHub to get the feedback to learn. So yeah, I appreciate his for concerns very much and let's go through them. Yeah the Lost coins. That is a question. That's asked more. How does that impact the the stock?  Does of course and how does that impact the stock to flow model and maybe your prediction so I did the analysis I implemented for different ways of adjusting for lost coins. The original way was to just ignore the first million coins so-called Satoshi coins. We don't know of course if those were still she coins, but that's that's the narrative and well those coins haven't moved. So so let's let's
5:  point which is  I think that the ETF model for cannabis is sort of over originally you could maybe buy a little bit of everything and everything kind of went up together and went down together. Right? So it was like you're sort of spread out over the sector the sector does. Well you do. Well, right. This will go into sort of the next episode which is about predictions going forward, but you're going to start to see the separation now from the winners from the losers in the markets from the good markets in the bad markets, so
6:  It's not necessary a race to the bottom, but it means that if you want to be a new entrant into the mark and you can make a splash you can come and drop your prices and that forces the hand of companies like steel and chewed they need to go out and match it. So it can be these sorts of things do happen in this sort of market and the company also hints at some write-offs that they're saying that and another update will be provided with a half your results and February 2022 next year.  And a canteen carrying values will be reassessed at that time. So I think there's a good chance that they'll be writing or some Goodwill in February. That's that's a prediction for you. I think it was a dollar seventy s year. They rejected in an offer from Fletcher building that that's about a hundred fifty million and Market difference from where the stock was trading at now and that and the management said that there was undervalued. So I think I said at the time that it would be
7:  One of the quotes are I guess two of the quotes that I had highlighted here and I'm looking at chapter 7 a reactive Trader is looking for confirmation and a predictive Trader is just guessing and then the next paragraph over Steve says the bottom line is that if you want to be a successful Trader, there must be a reason for everything you do based on price action and charts and really that's all you need to know don't just willy-nilly buy stocks. Don't just sell options. Don't just buy options. You have to have an actual.  Or reason as to why and then a reason as to why you're going to get out. Hey, this is a very controversial podcast. You're going to have Curtis. I can't wait process Quantified not I mean that's they never get past the predictions or the opinions are the that's the biggest problem of predicting is the future doesn't exist. And to think that you can figure out what every single person every single Trader an investor in every news source and every politician and and the Federal Reserve and other country. I mean II think that you can you know,
8:  I think that the ETF model for cannabis is sort of over originally you could maybe buy a little bit of everything and everything kind of went up together and went down together. Right? So it was like you're sort of spread out over the sector the sector does. Well you do. Well, right. This will go into sort of the next episode which is about predictions going forward, but you're going to start to see the separation now from the winners from the losers in the markets from the good markets in the bad markets, so  It's not so much about owning everything now and trying to ride the wave it's really about.
9:  And a canteen carrying values will be reassessed at that time. So I think there's a good chance that they'll be writing or some Goodwill in February. That's that's a prediction for you. I think it was a dollar seventy s year. They rejected in an offer from Fletcher building that that's about a hundred fifty million and Market difference from where the stock was trading at now and that and the management said that there was undervalued. So I think I said at the time that it would be  interesting to see if that if that fob off off pitcher building was a good thing little find out we had the first ever annual report for Port of Napier released during the week our well at least their first ever annual report in its life as a public company and they've gone next live on the pictures. It's quite impressive the reporters a hundred eight pages long, which is a pretty long in your report from New Zealand of that. I would say especially reasonably simple coming important Napier. I was there I would say around 50%
