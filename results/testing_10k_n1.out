Topic 9 trump call ukrainian president: The White House released a rough transcript of President Donald Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian President in November 2019.  What were people saying about the conversation in the call?  News items about the call are relevant.
0:  I don't like those guys. Those guys are my boys, but I cannot believe we have this Darth Vader guy in the fucking white house. When I say Darth Vader, I'm not saying I'm against him or I'm for him. But you have to admit we got a guy that's living in the 80s being the president in this fucking thing. You know what I mean? He's talking to the Ukrainian president. I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened. I'm gonna go touch with Jen tell him what happened you pretend you're the random rancid polisher.  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.
1:  so he's going after Biden. So he's basically telling the Ukrainian president. You'll give me shit on bite in and if you give me shit on bite and I'll give you fucking money. So that's like some fugged out gangster shit. You can't do that. Right? So the difference between the molar report which was going on for the last three or four years when they're trying to take him down and the difference between this is they actually got a taped conversation or they got some some messages. So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.
2:  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos? What the fuck's going on that damn, right? I don't want to see that. So he's trying to get dirt on Joe Biden because in Donald Trump sighs Joe Biden is the only one that he thinks kid what the beat him can beat him. Yeah, you know that the angle is he's not trying to get dirt on Elizabeth Warren, right? He thinks Bernie Sanders is fucking gone. He just thinks
3:  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos? What the fuck's going on that damn, right? I don't want to see that.

So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that
4:  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.
5:  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people  Idiots, I had to look at things differently. You will come this November when you're voted out because she was actually one of them that turn that seat. I don't think it's going to go. She ain't going to win this next one day and I think the Democrats lose the house they swore in Chief Justice John Roberts and 99 of the 100 Senators who will serve as jurors were sworn in what happened to the other Senator, huh?
6:  Audio tapes, but after the backlash he'd faced for the Saturday night Massacre. He knew that he couldn't simply ignore the subpoenas on May 1st. The White House released 1254 pages of edited transcripts of the recorded conversations. The White House is summary of the documents argued that they would put an end to the accusation since quote in all of the thousands of words spoken even though they often are unclear  And ambiguous not once does it appear that the president of the United States was engaged in a criminal plot to obstruct justice. But if the White House had truly believed this would remove the Shroud over Nixon's presidency. They were sorely mistaken rather than proving his innocence. The edited transcripts raised new questions about Watergate at one point Nixon discussed the prospect of raising a million dollars for a hush money.
7:  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.  They just shit on them. I mean they you know, Don Lemon is a homosexual man as we know Anderson Cooper is a homosexual man as we as we know but when they're performing and they're doing they're they're speaking as a broadcasters. They don't act what they don't act gay. They don't act gay of course. No, they act what very well straight and to the point. Yeah, but when they start to reporting on Donald Trump and they're getting pissed off to start know what well they start getting wild now they start acting what olestra
8:  Porn business Stormy Daniels Stormy Daniels who else probably others that I can't speak on don't know probably others. He was also having sex with Playmates Karen McDougal and guess what happened when he became president. Oh shut up this morning. They took they took the vagina away from him. And if they if you take the vagina if they if they take the vagina away from him. What's it going to make him do  He's getting a week. No crazy. Okay, right. He's gonna what tweet out. What? Oh, wow. Yeah wild shit. So Jen you can actually save the world can't I would you have sex and blow our President Donald Trump if he promises to just chill the fuck out and stop speaking ukrainians and stop breaking the law and just fucking run the country. Would you do that? I would suck his dick for a lot. Like what what what
9:  This to where it is today if Hunter didn't freaking get a job off his daddy and get millions of dollars. Maybe he wouldn't have made to ask to be investigated Dingle explain that supporting impeachment was necessary despite the potential repercussions. Yeah, you're going to lose your seat in Michigan because Trump is not above the law. Neither is Joe Biden hundred Biden and delete 30,000 emails Hillary Clinton and that there was a credible case that the  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people
 
Topic 10 boeing 737 crash causes: The Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliner was grounded worldwide after hundreds of people died in two crashes in 2019.  What were people saying about the airline and the company?  What were speculated causes of the crash?  What did people think the effect would be on Boeing’s reputation?  News is relevant, but so is speculation.
0:  He may run out people to fight eventually. They may be a the Amana have to fight the area next time it was shot for the rest of the franchise. I think it meant fide already final finale it meant six the final final finale and it meant seven confirmed by stop final and you cannot find it anymore finale then after that. I maybe we'll get a hit man precursor it boy the birth of it men from it boy to eat man Jane you do under international news the similarities between  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight. Apparently the FAA was so underfunded. They started to let Boeing certify their own brains. Well away own self check on self Syria, of course Boeing will pass their own airplanes are especially if you can tell your customers a our new 737 Max aircraft ever known only as
1:  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight. Apparently the FAA was so underfunded. They started to let Boeing certify their own brains. Well away own self check on self Syria, of course Boeing will pass their own airplanes are especially if you can tell your customers a our new 737 Max aircraft ever known only as  the simulator training one save money on training by our new planes just one hour on the iPad for each pilot. I will do and because we are bowing I declare it's not a new aircraft just a variant of the old one. I'm not even making the iPad training part a blur. I wish I was it's not even 1 hour is 56 minutes training on an iPad in reality a the 737 Max her is new in many ways. And also now allegedly flawed tragically flawed.
2:  Really going to be something that people want to fly on or that Airlines will want to use I think airlines are may be smart enough or maybe just careless enough or whatever to say. Like, wow, it's good enough for us. But if they know that passengers aren't going to like it then they might just not use it and and even some have been wondering you know, Boeing has another one. I think it's the 777x longer range obviously larger.  That may have some of the same design flaws and maybe that's a story to follow in the future. But anyways, so there's this problem here with with the obviously Boeing and how that plays into the economy and whatnot. But the other thing that I found just fascinating so recently Boeing basically asked for about ten billion dollars in a loan, right and that adds to a pretty large amount of liabilities already, which I'll go over here in a second in addition to a nine point five billion dollar line of credit in October.
3:  I don't know. That's where we're at today. It's just a question of when will this be escalated further get now? There's also the question of this airliner that was shot down in a neuron following are actually sort of during all these things going on last night. It was a civilian airliner Ukraine International Airlines or something along those lines. And if I remember correctly it was inbound for Ukraine we  This shot down the official story from Iran which thus far cannot be verified by anyone was that it had mechanical failures and crash. But of course such high mean is peculiar. I mean, it's it would be quite The Coincidence, of course a hundred eighty people lost their lives. So you have to ask you know, what? What was the meaning behind us? I don't think it would be a neurons best interest to say that this was some form of Revenge and I don't know. I don't know. I mean there's a lot of Canadians on the board. I mean, I guess you could say Ukraine is a bit of it.
4:  Since it's become more and more apparent that hey, this is a these were not flukes. This was not just a coincidence that two of them crashed in a relatively short time period but rather there were some major design flaws that Boeing very well may have been knowledgeable of that. They knew that this was a crappy airplane and that scared a lot of people and and you know at this point, it's the 737 Max is grounded. It's not fine. In fact  And so far as to that Boeing is shutting down production of the 737 Max, you know in this is, you know, economically speaking a huge company here in the United States and and the you know, if this continues I mean it's going to legitimately cut into economic growth. We're talking to a few basis points or whatever few tens of basis points a camera of his Kudlow or something else that was recently talking about that and it's obviously not going to be better. I mean Boeing tries to put a
5:  Right and our first episode most people who survived were sitting in the mid cabin section. Yep, right in the middle. Yep.  There's no great part of the plane to sit in it's completely unpredictable per each crash. Yep. It depends on where it crashes how crashes how hard it it crashes if type of Crash. Yeah, if I bring back my ear. Yeah, it has been basically undetermined of what seat is safest to sit in there basically isn't one. Yeah, I guess I have a question. I mean his someone published a study on what if there is a safest part and determined that there is no like statistically significant safest.
6:  Okay, speaking of plane crashes Ashley. So evidently they used real bones, like real human corpse bones for the that like flooded pool scene in the original film. That's so gross. And so in the second movie one of the guys that was the main character there. He he's an he gets in a plane crash like he's just in a regular plane and the plane goes down and he survives but he's 1 out of  Out of like that plane crash kills like 27 out of 51 people on the plane. Holy shit, which is wild also again, like maybe planes just weren't that safe. I don't know. I don't know either. They don't sound very safe. You know what? I mean? Yeah, so also, okay. So from the original movie that little blond girl she died at 12. Yay from like flu-like symptoms or whatever she times so I guess like the 80s. Yeah. She died.
7:  There's no great part of the plane to sit in it's completely unpredictable per each crash. Yep. It depends on where it crashes how crashes how hard it it crashes if type of Crash. Yeah, if I bring back my ear. Yeah, it has been basically undetermined of what seat is safest to sit in there basically isn't one. Yeah, I guess I have a question. I mean his someone published a study on what if there is a safest part and determined that there is no like statistically significant safest.  Heart during a crash I'm sure there is but you have to look it up. Yeah, let's do a meta-analysis on this. There you go. You can take that on while I study for your test under the investigators eventually looked into many possibilities. Why would the airplane have broken up there were nine possibilities given. Yeah, it's a list there were nine possibilities that the decided to look into the first one being mid-air Collision, but there were five.
8:  positive spin on this all you know, it's shutting down production by think they said initially no layoffs. I don't know if that's still the case that maybe by mail this year. Maybe we'll have it back in the skies. But even once it's cleared by the FAA and other Regulatory Agencies around the world, I'm not so sure that it's  Really going to be something that people want to fly on or that Airlines will want to use I think airlines are may be smart enough or maybe just careless enough or whatever to say. Like, wow, it's good enough for us. But if they know that passengers aren't going to like it then they might just not use it and and even some have been wondering you know, Boeing has another one. I think it's the 777x longer range obviously larger.
9:  Over a small amount of money but like the rest of them are just like yeah, he just died like before old age. Like they just died at like 50 because they spent the their entire life like probably coping with trauma with drugs and alcohol. So yeah, that makes sense like it happens. Unfortunately. Yeah really sad, but I don't know if it's a curse, you know, that's like the child starkers. Like if you want to be a child star, that's the kind of shit.  You have to deal with growing up a true in that environment under that kind of pressure and scrutiny or whatever exactly yikes all the plane crashes. I don't know why I think of plane crashes is so rare there quite a bit and they're supposed to be rare. They're supposed to be rare. It's supposed to be safer than driving same with lightning strikes that's supposed to be you're supposed to I don't know. I think I mean, I think that's why they people are like

Topic 12 imran khan career: Imran Khan is the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, and had a career as an international cricket star.  What have people said about his career and achievements?
0:  Those steps my senses that Masood Azhar may be treated with the same kind of indulgence. But Pakistan would have to demonstrate its own quote unquote good faith in relation to the financial action task force. So while it would be desirable to have a country like Pakistan supporting this kind of an Endeavor in a very very sincere way. The reality is that Pakistan's own internal patterns preferences choices both political and otherwise are inhibiting meaningful cooperation because they are also aware that  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.
1:  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.  In being part of the global Endeavor, we will have a situation where they could be more like a horse you were talking about a small D's reports are not very encouraging. It's apparently one of the nation's from where large number of people have gone and join the Islamic State their comeback. Now these attacks in Sri Lanka you're referring to reports in the media elsewhere about how there is an interconnected or there are some traces of connection. So to say between India and these people who have carried out these strikes now once you know, I make an ism like this comes
2:  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in
3:  Prime Minister of Pakistan like about the 1992 World Cups just dinner right? He's unlocked some doors. He's full value on Twitter though. Like I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but he he's not afraid slate opinion most recently about Shahid Afridi decision to the band his daughters from playing Cricket. Yeah, that's quite a lot of trolling or shared freely going on there. That's an area we  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.
4:  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.  Um, so that's a little bit of the back story of the great creaking nation of Pakistan. I think you are everyone should be Brewing Pakistan. It would make their day if they want the bulk up. Yeah, there's not being international cricket played there for a number of years because security reasons, they finally get back to that position where actually the safety in their main cities is good. Yep, and they want people to come back and play like it's huge thing is over. I love Pakistani. Yeah. I mean I think offering them they're my favorite team in the tournament as do you say
5:  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in  And your you can hear a pin drop in that Pakistan dressing room. Nobody's talking to anybody. They all looking at their feet. All the players in one corner is Imran. And he said Sonny talks briefly to me and then he looks up and so this team from Pakistan was supposed to take the flight out that evening that night come to Bombay.
6:  Of the great spells of bowling. I mean India or otherwise, I mean Malcolm Marshall how it doesn't get better than that, right? Who wants to go next? Visit Vijay? Yes it hello everyone. This is Vijay are moving from Sydney. I'm going to pick Roger Binny from 1987 the second test match between India and Pakistan. So Imran Khan's Pakistan visited India for a five test series against couple days Indians. This was before  The Reliance cup so this happened in the January February timeframe of 1987 after the high scoring draw in the first test match and Madras 1987 the Caravan moved to Eden Gardens Calcutta back, then it was Calcutta still and Sunil gavaskar refused to play at the Eden Gardens citing the crowd trouble that happened in the 8485 test match against England and Imran Khan having won the toss put India in thinking. Okay. There is no Galveston. Let me get some early wickets.
7:  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India. So in that perspective Benny spell was a really important one to help India to get some psychological advantage of a Pakistan against a very  be strong batting lineup and also another interesting thing. I don't know if that played any part be a ten-year-old. I heard the word smog the first time in my life are Morgan the famous journalist who covered the game for the Hindu in the sport star, he wrote in that particular weekly saying the smoke cleared and the brief started coming from the hooghly and the calculations are filled up the stands with 70,000 people and the Metro was serving the city like London and Paris and Roger Binny put on a royal show here.
8:  Using bit of a natural element he was able to reduce Pakistan to very manageable first Innings total that helped India to set it up in terms of the game. Unfortunately, India couldn't finish the game off and Pakistan happened to save that game despite being getting another two wickets. So in that particular spell I'm talking about it took six 456 including four four nine four four nine against a very powerful batting lineup in Indian conditions has to be applauded because he wasn't  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India. So in that perspective Benny spell was a really important one to help India to get some psychological advantage of a Pakistan against a very
9:  Which descended on the Gaddafi that moment when the last you know, when the match was decided is something that takes me back and it was like Gloom had descended and I feared okay. I have no idea what might happen next. Yeah, people might you know, start a riot out of sheer disappointment within a few minutes wailing started people started crying specially the Jannah section where the women were sitting they couldn't believe it at all and I was in a very in a sense a privileged position.  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.

1:  She seemed more open to the idea after hearing me say that but still held firm that now wasn't a good time. She told me that while she was overseas. She handled The Break-Up by self-medicating with alcohol various drugs and cutting well.  That certainly came out of nowhere didn't it? We had no indication of any of that going on and then all of a sudden she's dripping, you know, drinking all the time doing various drugs and cunning.

4:  Was best to choose in terms of the different things that I do so I sort of specialized in addiction treatment. When I in the sense that I worked in addiction treatment when I came out for University from after studying psychology and psycho social sciences, and I got an A placement in an addictions Center and I started learning about the motivational tools that were used by practitioners in addiction treatment and by people in long-term recovery from addiction to keep themselves.  Automated and to keep up the changes that they'd make despite changing really ingrained habits. Yeah, and so I started applying the same sort of tools to myself sharing them with people. I was meeting Etc. And then eventually I helped someone to change. I helped the journalist from the pool maresa baked to change her drinking habits, and she wrote an article about it and of the back of that article, I became an author that's a very long story short and
5:  Yeah, I thought it was quite interesting and my friend there. She said it and I completely agreed with it. So yeah second thing I wanted to talk about his addictions. I know it's a big it's a big like jump from friendships to addictions and it might be random but it's something that I want to talk about for a long time.  Specific drug addictions, you can technically be mentally addicted to anything. It's just a human instant, but when it comes to hard drugs, you have a choice of whether you want to go down this road or not. I've read a lot of stories about people who had abused drugs. They specifically hard drugs in the past and they had been clean for years.
6:  Materially, so we're going to move on to your I have which is an and I can hear this in everything you say I have enormous respect for those in addiction recovery and a lot to thank them for can you tell us a bit more about that? I think the average person in addiction recovery knows more so much more about personal development resilience self care compassion boundaries resentment these Concepts that we don't be  That's cool. Shame guilt and has strategies for them that our bespoke and evidence-based whether or not they know it or not are evidence based and community and connection and spirituality like these there are a wealth of personal development resources sitting for free in the recovery community and the thought that people who are in recovery would be
7:  Specific drug addictions, you can technically be mentally addicted to anything. It's just a human instant, but when it comes to hard drugs, you have a choice of whether you want to go down this road or not. I've read a lot of stories about people who had abused drugs. They specifically hard drugs in the past and they had been clean for years.  But believe it or not.
8:  Diction or homelessness or you know, like you said a dual diagnosis of several things. It can be very easy to say. I'm okay. I have a roof over my head. I have a job. I have a but this space for both the space space for you to be healthy and look after yourself as well as space for you to help that person but you have to help yourself as well. Otherwise, you can't you can't do either so you can't continue to do it long term. Yeah, which yeah, which is my main.

Topic 14 near death experiences: I wonder if people have shared near-death experiences in podcast episodes.  I would like to find and listen to some stories.  I am not interested in the science of near-death experiences.
0:  It to make sure that you're the more you read in the more you listen to other people's stories. I think the easier the allyship stuff conversation happens because you are not just going off what you think you're going off people's experiences and it makes it a much more individualistic human connection experience rather than rather than something that's like really politicized or made into the narrative that white people want us to hear.  Yeah. Yeah, I think that that last line like really kind of hits the nail on the head like you actually get to experience.
1:  That like how I shared honored us and our shared experience that that really mattered to me because it was important that this relationship come to a romantic close with Grace and like honoring that it was special and sacred and meaningful and I mean on the best right? That's what makes it so fucking hard is and you don't it will anybody anything now on someone else to fuck an opinion about how I should handle it or what I should say to the public or  What my relationship ending means for them. I don't give a shit. Like don't plays Hope in me. Like you can look to me for advice or thoughts, but I'm not your God. I'm not you don't put me on a pedestal. I'm not your Guru. Like I'm just a guy who's also in the midst of this experience who just happens to write about it and think about it and say like hey, I might be a chapter ahead in some areas, but I'm also a chapter behind and also just
2:  Infographics and be like I want you to come speak at my event like definitely not that would not be nearly enough at all. When I wonder how well it translates to sales. Like honestly, I think like maybe the beginning it did but like I'll yeah, the other problem with it too is especially on Instagram. You can gain a lot of followers, but are they engaged followers are a people who are going to turn around and actually buy things and write every guest that we've ever had when they have shared our podcast through their different social media channels guess.  Guess who had the highest number of downloads we can proc soluble or episode and that was yours. So you're the only guest has ever gone over 10,000 downloads on an episode. But like that was also probably at the peak of I don't know. It's interesting because like I said, it's a lot of the take you down expense or wanted to take you down did what his did you but even that's enough quite happen when people are using Instagram changing now too because we can see through a proxy kind of how the trans go.
3:  Feel like shit. Yeah, whereas in my you know in eight at 18, I could eat fucking french fries for the rest of my life and I wouldn't gain gain anything listen and call it like an undergrad before you knew me at Florida State. I would go out and like if we went out then that night we would order pizza and I would eat pizza. Yeah, but even then like if I smoked and got higher something I would always want like like I would eat like an orange like I just that's just what I like, you know what I wonder if since I've  Ever gotten high before if we might want to explore that for the podcast on the podcast. Yeah, I think actually I would have to deal with Brian first because I think he'd get mad at me if I didn't share that experience with him. Okay, you guys do that and that we should eat an edible on the podcast because I'd be more fun like really get hot. I mean either one would be fun. But first of all, we probably don't like smoke in here. Oh, yeah total it if we eat an edible, it'll be like really funny. But who would we interview or would it just be us?
4:  Yeah, I'm happy that I'm talking to you. Okay, it's okay. I mean like this is this is cool being back home in the states. I didn't think that I would be on a podcasting in yoga Barn like this is crazy. This is crazy. Right? We've kind of settled into this normalcy of being out here, but when I watch this in six months or a year, wherever I am I'm gonna be like wow like that really was cool. Like there really was rapid really so I'm just trying to have these experiences of like, how did I get here type experiences like I'm trying to  This unique story for myself so that I can look back and be like, I lived a pretty cool life. I like explored thing. Like I was interested in something and I started to do it. Yeah. I want to hear this story about how you lost weight. I'm very interested in to psychology into into the way the brain operates meditation has given me this Advanced self awareness of really understanding like how I'm successful. There's there's going to be there's a recurring theme Here creating external circumstances to necessitate change.
5:  I think you hard it's all hard. Thank you so much for having this conversation with me today, and it's morning. Happy Monday. I definitely you will definitely be on the podcast together at some point. You're like, what else do you do behind the scenes? I mean a million things the podcast could just be you and I talked to the forever. So thank you. Thank you so much. All right, my love. Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.  Wow, that was an incredible first episode of Life. Anyway podcast with my mentor Nina Ernst we went really deep and that's really what this space is about is the uncomfortable but necessary conversations around what this Human Experience is about. So to go right to death one of the if not the biggest topic and afterlife and all the other things that go around it was
6:  Our cultural relationship to death and resistance to death and how we can better process our grief how we can protect ourselves and it's just a very real raw human conversation. I will say that it could be possibly triggering to you if you've been through a lot of death recently. It could also be really supportive. It's not a conversation. I don't think this podcast will ever be one that you want to listen.  Into with your kids in the car as I I use very colorful language at times. So does Nina to in this one and we're talking about really hard stuff in different moments. So be prepared for that, but I think that it could be if you're here and if you're listening, I actually know that this is going to be a healing and really uplifting experience for you.
7:  I have to my sister but I'm also like why didn't you tell me because we all shared a room. My mom has six kids. Yeah, and three kids shared a room and three other kids shirt or with him and I shared a room with my sister and I was like, wow, you didn't tell me there was a ghost. Yeah, you didn't think that was like necessary information. She was trying to protect you, you know, it's gonna be okay from not telling me anything like if there was a bear in someone's like hey, here's something you were like. Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing just she'll go back to the tent. It's fine. Just go to sleep like that doesn't mean  There's not a bear like she should have told me she didn't tell me until I started the podcast that's fucked up. Yeah, and she was also makes me think that she's lying like well, let me tell you she is a huge liar and I'm going to tell you that because she doesn't listen to the podcast. She doesn't listen to it because she's scared. She doesn't like scary things because she saw a ghost, but I know she's lying. No, I think she really did see a ghost because I did see a lot of ghosts in the house that we used to have and now that I'm sitting at we're at Dan's house and I'm seeing Ernest.
8:  Already and realness that Natalie has in each episode the guests so far have been so insightful and really genuine at sharing their stories. Lush giving advice. Katie has been my favorite this far. I'm 24 and graduated with an elementary education degree. So it's so refreshing to hear her share about her experience as a young teacher. Each episode gets better and better give one a try. Thank you so much Sophie because that is exactly what I want this podcast to bring. I want it to be intentional. I wanted to bring realness which is why the name is even the real real like I want you.  Guys to hear people that sound and are like similar and are similar to you. Not just people that you aspire to be like success stories, even though I am so pumped to interview people like that as well. But I want it to look like you like be more relatable and I don't know just have something to look forward to know that you guys aren't alone in the world that you're in or also just if you're curious about the way other people live their lives. It's a great way for someone else to share their story.
9:  And kind of tool allyship is really by reading people's experiences. That's one of my favorite ways to get to know people and everybody's different but reading great books of experiences of fatness or racism or you know, it doesn't mean I'll ever understand marginalized communities that are unlike me because I can walk a day in their shoes but it gives a frame of reference that I probably wouldn't have had because mainstream media doesn't show their stories. So it's important.  It to make sure that you're the more you read in the more you listen to other people's stories. I think the easier the allyship stuff conversation happens because you are not just going off what you think you're going off people's experiences and it makes it a much more individualistic human connection experience rather than rather than something that's like really politicized or made into the narrative that white people want us to hear.
 
Topic 15 podcast about podcasts: I would like to start a podcast.  What equipment do I need?  What kind of microphone?  What sort of space should I use to record?  What software is most helpful?  What are some tips and tricks for using my voice well?  I’d like to hear general tips about recording and producing podcasts.
0:  Is different creation tools on the platform where you can make your own podcast and like you can record and edit it right from your phone or your computer, which is like crazy because you don't need all this fancy equipment. And like I said, it's free. So you're saving money that way too and then my personal favorite thing about anchor and like the main reason why I use it is because anchor will literally distribute your podcast for you so it can be heard on all different platforms that  At like basically any podcast can be distributed so it can be heard through Spotify Apple podcast Stitcher Google podcasts and many many more. So all you do is submit your podcast link and they literally distributed everywhere for you, which is incredible and overall. It's everything you need to make a podcast in one place. So it's super easy. I can't recommend it enough. I personally use this every week and I just love it so much. I recommend it to every one of my friends that want to
1:  Month to month after that. It's a lot easier to add up those like months audits to like a year, you know. Yes, whatever. It is. Got you outta here. Okay. So now we're going to pause the episode really quickly to talk about one of my favorite things ever that I use literally every day Spotify. I love Spotify so much because you can listen to all of your favorite artists and podcasts all in one place for free like you don't even need a premium account. They have every artist in every podcast you can imagine and I  it love how user-friendly it is and like even the layout of the app. I don't know. I literally use it every day. I listen to music and podcasts on the way to work like to and from work. So I'm a huge fan of it Spotify has such a huge catalogue of podcast on every topic including the one you're listening to right now, but seriously, I listen to all different kinds of podcasts on there and I honestly can't recommend it enough on Spotify. You can follow your favorite podcast. So you never miss an episode.
2:  And again on that but podcast, you know, so I don't want them to like take me down. Yeah full podcast. If you like them to know better use only five star reviews only know I've seen some podcasts that get really bad reviews. I know they're like they say some really bad stuff and I just do I agree.  Yeah, I got that I do but I don't understand like if you have something negative to say just stop listening. I know I mean, yeah, it is helpful to have criticism. But how do you have the I don't know I just could never get myself to write a bad review. I know it's mean it is like if you don't listen like other people listen and other people like it, so just I appreciate that.
3:  I have been watching her Vlogs along with a bunch of you guys and I always just love meeting other people in the industry. And I don't know I feel like it's such a good way to make friends and meet people and network and I was really excited when we decided to record the podcast together so I cannot wait for you guys to listen. We talked all about YouTube how to get started what sets people apart just give really really great tips and advice for you guys on if you guys are trying to start a YouTube what kind of takes start one and  why you should it's definitely a very very encouraging podcast episode. So I'm really excited for you guys to listen and before I get into the podcast I wanted to thank the reviewer of the week. So thank you guys so much for reviewing this podcast. This one is from Peggy. She said I originally found out at least channel from Tasha's video, but after giving a glance on her Channel, I'm obsessed with her lifestyle and her personality. Of course when she came up with this podcast. I was a literally thrilled the content about the podcasts are so down-to-earth educational motivated and
4:  So of you know recording your podcast and starting out, did you have any mentors or people to kind of help you out or you looked up to for advice? Not really there weren't really shy but anybody the podcasting space in particular that I was really looking up to when I was figuring out how to structure my show as far as like the different segments and stuff. I went through and listen to a bunch of different peoples podcasts and really just took notes on like how they structure their show. Do they ask the same questions every time.  Time do they what do they do differently? Like how does their intro sound like what about music? So yeah when I was going through I definitely did that it a lot of research but there was never really any anybody in particular that I listen to very frequently or like that. I really look up to in the space. I definitely take a little bit from everywhere the the one podcast that I will listen to like every episode of is he had my let show I really like what he's doing with his podcast. So he's definitely one that I look up to the most I used to listen to Gary bees podcast a lot.
5:  And I was blogging and it is fine. But I just felt like it wasn't like a personal enough connection because they couldn't hear my voice. They couldn't see me they're serving my words. Yeah, that was a little less formal. So I felt like blogging it's kind of like formal and I feel like with podcasting you can kind of be in someone's ear BFF style. Yeah, really really fun for me and I have been guests on podcast before I was like, okay cool. Like let's try this. So that's kind of why I started my podcasts and I can't imagine not doing it now like I barely blog anymore.  Or all I do is podcast and I knew I needed some kind of personal element and video was just not for me. I mean, I still do it every so often but I didn't want to be my main content stream because water pressure. Yeah, I'd rather I'd rather get podcasting because you can't you can you can record in your pajamas with you want exactly an outdoor about lighting or anything yet? No, I'm not Kim Kardashian. Yes also side know I love podcast because I also just feel like you can binge like 30 and just have it in the background and I
6:  Through exactly. So that's kind of my focus. I'm shifting more to doing social media marketing for podcasters and marketing for podcasters versus like, you know, just general business owners. Okay, and how did you get into podcasting? So I started my podcast back in January of 2018. So about a year and a half ago a little over a year and a half and I just so I am not a I'm pretty shy. You know me. I knew I knew I needed to do something.  And I was blogging and it is fine. But I just felt like it wasn't like a personal enough connection because they couldn't hear my voice. They couldn't see me they're serving my words. Yeah, that was a little less formal. So I felt like blogging it's kind of like formal and I feel like with podcasting you can kind of be in someone's ear BFF style. Yeah, really really fun for me and I have been guests on podcast before I was like, okay cool. Like let's try this. So that's kind of why I started my podcasts and I can't imagine not doing it now like I barely blog anymore.
7: Welcome to the go digital Jason. No show where I interview business owners and Founders alive on the strategies in digital transformation and how it is scale their businesses to the next level. If you are looking to grow digitally and this is the podcast for you stay tuned for today's special guest as this podcast starts in three two one.  Hey there, I'm very excited today because I am actually recording this podcast at found eight. So found it is the latest co-working space located at KL sentral which is an amazing place to actually come Co share ideas and things like that and for to these podcasts I have someone very special very amazing. I just met him like just one to two weeks ago. Yeah, and I just had a lot one our discussion with him. So today I have Christopher talk with me. I visited his office our social groups.
8:  Is that you know, you are able to listen to them really quickly and get a lot out of them without having to dedicate the time they eat what you know church or traditional blog post or even a YouTube video to a certain extent and you're going to want to like see the content. So I really think podcasts are about to be the next big thing. That's why I'm happening now exactly exactly and then just like obviously since I'm just starting out my podcast as well. I have some selfish questions, so  Tips on starting your own podcasting mean lay them all out. I can how much lead time do you suggest giving yourself before starting the podcast? You know, I usually say like no less than 60 days because I think it takes because you need to really have a good content strategy. If you're having guests you need to book those guess you can't just go like hey, I'm actually launching my podcast like next week. What's got ya and but it's just not as not as beneficial for you, especially if you want a battle of episodes in advance.
9:  Into and inspirational end-of-the-year message. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?  I need you know, how how do I do this? Because I had no clue. So what I got from my research was that we needed a good set of microphones. They told me that audio is important. They meaning Google and all the YouTube tutorials on podcasting what I got from it was that audio was important considering that a hundred percent of the time you're going to be listening to our voices. So if our voice is all you hear the night,
 
Topic 16 causes and prevention of wildfires: 2019 saw a large number of wildfires, in Australia, California, and the Amazon.  What were people saying about them?  What caused them?  How could they be prevented?  I am interested in news reports but also speculation, rumor, and unverified information.
0:  There and Martin caused property destruction death and Pally across parts of Europe and created an electrical failure that affected most of France the worst cyclone in French history brought down transmission lines and caused large swaths of the country to be without power for three days repairing. The lines was a grueling and expensive task and generators had to be brought in from as far as Canada to act as interim power sources economic losses were estimated at over 18 billion euros and the new record for the largest power disruption in history was quickly.  Spurred across the Atlantic from Brazil number 5 Taiwan back out of 1999 the evening of July the 29th 1999 began in Taiwan with the blasting of a warning siren over the city of Taipei. This was followed by loss of electricity across the country causing widespread speculation and rumor as to what could have caused such a nationwide power outage speculation ranged from a Chinese Invasion to a nuclear attack but reality was much more mundane a landslide knocked out pylon cables creating a domino effect.
1:  Spurred across the Atlantic from Brazil number 5 Taiwan back out of 1999 the evening of July the 29th 1999 began in Taiwan with the blasting of a warning siren over the city of Taipei.

Back to the left millions of people both literally and figuratively in the dark number 4 1998 Auckland power crisis, Auckland New Zealand found itself without power for a staggering five weeks after the four main cables supplying the city with electricity suffered mechanical damage. The cables were repeatedly heated up and cooled down by auckland's unusual January weather the old and poorly maintained cables eventually failed one after the other forcing the city to use backup diesel generators the noise of several hundred diesel.
2:  Let's yeah, let's see what let's see what happens. Should we jump over to some Spidey land news? Let's talk Spidey. I mean, obviously there's a lot of there's a lot of talk about Spider-Man there's different rumors about whether what's going to happen with the deals we go into all that we're not going to because it's a waste of time because it's all speculation and any news outlet that tells you that they have the answer is lying to you. I personally like the rumor that Sony's going to get sold to Apple. I think that's I did see that one. Yeah well here so  Anything on that if Sony was to set if Sony was to sell Sony Pictures, which is all their TV and movie stuff is under Sony Pictures to Apple which is a rumor because apple is trying to build like a library so they can fill out there because they had like a nine shows right now. And if they buy I didn't even know they had nine Jason Momoa was blind Snoopy's and space and a few others. I'd only heard about three. Yeah, but
3:  You want to know about the Reefer Madness bro? Let me tell you about it. Let me tell you about it rumor has it one of the main reasons that they met we'd illegal after the Mississippi purchase was because California wasn't even a part of the Mississippi purchase. Boom. Bitch. Take it take it accept it in your soul. Look at that is look at the eyes.  Look at them honesty and one rumor has it one of the reasons. Why is it rumors to these are rumors that are in my brain Rumor Has It?
4:  Intimidation from what we can tell with this one. This isn't the case or certainly not with the senior players and it's a really interesting one because usually is as journalists and media. We have an inkling, you know, we had an inkling over over her ass because the reports coming out and New Zealand we had an inkling over Mark Samson with after he lost his job with England because there are a lot of reports and rumors that were flying around before he lost his job statute has come completely out of the blue. No one saw this one coming and and  Happened very very quickly as well. I mean it was you know of Football Federation Australia have called a press conference on Friday and Saturday morning he's sacked so they have acted really quickly and a lot of us don't know what the reasoning is behind it. So, what do you got? Yeah, that's what I was gonna say that the fact that it happened so quickly and the time that the world cup is what makes me think that I think there's a lot more to this and than the bits and pieces were hearing like I think there's I'm not saying he's like a terrible person.
5:  For them, but kind of is not produced Jurassic world you produce Jurassic Park. Anyway, all that aside. Kevin feige is making a Star Wars movie or developed developing again developing a Star Wars movie and I'm excited to see what ever it is. Yeah, I think and I'm gonna watch it. I think that they're very cautious about just taking him fully away from Marvel, you know, I mean the this is a Star Wars movie. Let's see where it goes. So yeah.  Let's yeah, let's see what let's see what happens. Should we jump over to some Spidey land news? Let's talk Spidey. I mean, obviously there's a lot of there's a lot of talk about Spider-Man there's different rumors about whether what's going to happen with the deals we go into all that we're not going to because it's a waste of time because it's all speculation and any news outlet that tells you that they have the answer is lying to you. I personally like the rumor that Sony's going to get sold to Apple. I think that's I did see that one. Yeah well here so
6:  I'd like to see on the big screen but alas this is just a rumor along with the rumor that we may also get to see Clea Nightmare and maybe even name or in the next Doctor Strange movie sadly. We will have to wait until over a year to see the finished product. But that doesn't mean we won't get casting and character confirmations before then so fingers crossed and in other news the directors of bad boys for life have reportedly met with Marvel. Nothing was set in stone rather the studio wanted to see what they might be interested in working on an interview with  Book they said quote. There's nothing concrete. They just met us. They said that they liked the movie and they just told us yo, what do you want to do? Let's find something to work together on so there's nothing really planned yet. It was just like a meeting. But yeah mostly if we find something cool now with Disney plus it is all evolved so much that there's so much you can do so it looks like there might be two more directors joining the family and we will be eagerly awaiting the news as see what they might be working on in the Marvel universe. That's it for us here at Marvel News Daily.

Topic 17 time between meetings: I am looking for some ideas for things to do during breaks between meetings.  I would like to take advantage of my short (half hour or less) gaps between meetings to refocus my mind or relax.
0:  Other tips include unsubscribing from newsletters that threatened to distract you at all hours of the day turning your email notifications off and keeping your emails short really short. Don't worry about being rude through a brief email being briefed as a sign of respect for the other person's time as well as your own some movement suggest limiting your emails to just five sentences or less. You can always add additional resources to your email for clarification and further explanations.  Chapter 5 say no to meetings. How many times do you leave a meeting thinking? Well, that was a waste of time. It happens and many places have worked him to fall into this trap of scheduling meetings for the sake of touching base and scheduling a meeting. This practice is a hindrance to productivity and research even suggests that more than half of employees find meetings to be complete time-wasters for instance research presented by atlassian suggest that employees attend an average of 62.
1:  Supported as a whole but we're not quite there. So what can you do in the meantime? So one of the one of the things that popped up in the group was around meetings and around if you're stuck in a meeting for an hour and a half and if you're in any business that has more than 10 15 20 employees meetings still seem to be at the Forefront of what companies think they're about, you know, you get stuck in those board tables and and usually someone who's got a left brain talks really slowly with it.  Without pictures and you're having to kind of create the pictures in your head to kind of follow along that happens a lot. You know, what you'll find with the dyslexic ADHD or any mind like ours is that we are naturally picture visual people even if we can't always see our photos were more Visual and also we're very much kinesthetic Learners. So we learn by doing experience. I always I always remember when I was at work once I had to train someone on a computer system. I'd never seen before.

Eating's per month with half of those considered wasted time additionally a survey conducted by Microsoft among 38 thousand employees and 200 countries suggested that people spend five point six hours each week in meetings 69 percent of participants consider the meetings to be not productive. So why are meetings such a waste of time? Well Cruise offers two reasons for this phenomenon first meeting participants tend to spend time on on pressing.

Are in significant issues second extroverts typically dominate meetings making others less likely to participate as a result many meetings fail to offer up the most valuable information.
4:  I put down my priorities for the day that are in line with my vision and like my long-term objectives, you know, I hydrate I get a good breakfast or if I'm fasting what you know, whatever the case may be. I make sure my environments clean and conducive of like, you know success where I can focus and then I really like stimulate my mind and my brain full of all these ideas and these videos and I kind of just and in and absorb kind of mode and then  Then I'll you know obviously take breaks in between maybe for lunch or whatever. And then I really focus the second half of the day on like output and that's when I'll make my calls or I'll set up meetings or I'll work on a project or you know build, you know, help build a website or whatever it is that I'm working on and so taking that approach into Building 2020 has you know helped me tremendously, you know, I've taken courses and accelerators that have been taught by some of the
5:  In it and you're experiencing all parts of it. I just I always think of that with mindfulness, but if it's too hard, so how so you're looking the two things you're looking at is how what's happening the stressor how it's affecting you the result. It's having on you and then what you're projecting as a result of that stress. Yeah, like what you're projecting or even just like  If you were to walk into a meeting like IEP meeting if you're in the school or like caregiver meeting carefully unlike when you walk into the room like how you're feeling and maybe what you make be projecting to them when you walk in, but then also like what is the room sending back to you when you walk in? You know, we'll just see how sending you like. What are we looking at? Like nonverbal language? Are we looking at like eye contact? Like, how are we judging?
6:  Then I'll you know obviously take breaks in between maybe for lunch or whatever. And then I really focus the second half of the day on like output and that's when I'll make my calls or I'll set up meetings or I'll work on a project or you know build, you know, help build a website or whatever it is that I'm working on and so taking that approach into Building 2020 has you know helped me tremendously, you know, I've taken courses and accelerators that have been taught by some of the  Artist people in the world, which is one of them in particular is called the Y combinator at Stanford which kind of accelerated Airbnb to becoming a billion billion dollar company from just an idea. And so, you know, these are resources that are available online that I took and it's a 20-week course taught by some of the smartest Minds in the world and you know business and in all reality manifestation in the sense of a business or a company, but I just put inputted so many things into my mind that when I started doing my output
7:  The little shop in between y'all have to stop by that really good hours. So we'll give them a shout-out and Courtyard will take some pictures in there. It's like the best thing the best coffee shop. Yeah. It's like this like very quality is not like Starbucks. Yeah. It's like a gym like, you know, like every little city has like the place to be like that isn't like party. That is like so chill you could do anything. You can like go on a meeting and go on a little date.  Like hang out. Me and Charlotte had like meetings there. Did we have met today? No, I've had meetings there plenty of times every day, but I went on a meeting. I met my manager there. We stayed there for two hours and just hung out and the vibe is good. The music was good. There's a little outside part and I really reminds me. I'm like French coffee shops. It's not like not like Starbucks or PJ's because it's like more like feel like more warm and yes the wind the way they decorated it make them feel like living.
8:  In my head, I could build up the pictures of kind of what it did and I had all these pictures in the back of my brain from how I'd experienced similar software systems. And so I did a two hour training with a one-on-one training with a customer and I'd never used the software before but by the end of it she goes. Oh, you're so good at this and I was like, yeah. Yeah, I am because I could just get through it like that. That's that's the power of our minds and they're so so powerful and in that meeting I really  seeded and I think one of the challenges we all have is in those meetings our brains rush off we go in different directions. It can be very hard to stay at least be able to stay present. So it's really important, you know, in some meetings like that. It's quite important to look at different things. You can use I use an app called oughta o TT ER AI now if you have a look at that, you can download it. I think there's a free version and what it
9:  When Crews interviewed billionaire Mark Cuban, his best productivity advice was never take meetings. Unless someone is writing a check Crews recognize is that meetings are notorious time killers. They start late have the wrong people in them Meandering their topics and run long. You should get out of meetings whenever you can hold fewer of them yourself, and if you do run a meeting keep it short  Remember that time is money. So in addition to keeping meetings to a minimum, you should also learn how and when to say no.
 
Topic 18 women in stem: I’d like to hear personal stories from women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  I am not interested in initiatives to increase women in STEM, or movements surrounding women in STEM, or news reports about the prevalence of women in STEM.
0:  To learn so I think for my role specifically I know that even people who have been doing it for a long time, you know still learn a lot of things everyday. So I think it's just the dynamic of the business and the dynamic of you know, the customers in general. So I think it'll it'll take a while.  It's gonna get a little more in depth about you as a person and what you've been doing with your career specifically so, you know for being a Latina in stem. What are some things that you think are challenges for you and others like you in the stem Fields? Yeah. I think the biggest challenge that I faced as a Latino woman was the huge culture shock in my first
1:  It's gonna get a little more in depth about you as a person and what you've been doing with your career specifically so, you know for being a Latina in stem. What are some things that you think are challenges for you and others like you in the stem Fields? Yeah. I think the biggest challenge that I faced as a Latino woman was the huge culture shock in my first  Chef I think leaving from El Paso to Missouri in and of itself, you know was a huge move, you know, you know for me, you know growing up in El Paso and never really leaving it was you know difficult to leave and even if it was just a couple months of just you know, I was really scared to go. And so when I moved it was, you know shocking to be the only Hispanic, you know in the facility, you know, and you know in this
2:  Well, you know getting to know each other as people you learn, you know to care for them in a different way or you learn to get to know them and see them as a person and you know connect with them and it's very individual way. So I think that's definitely been the biggest challenge, you know, being the only woman in classes sometimes, you know, sometimes you're like, you know eight out of like 70 or something definitely for like Mike Mckenna.  Kle engineering classes and even now, you know, it's not just about stem Fields. It's also in business, you know incorporate in general manufacturing. I think we're always, you know minority and I think now even in meeting sometimes, you know, how time one out of two in a meeting of you know, 20 or you know, just just generally always the minority. So I think it's just learning to to know that you have a spot.
3:  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so  You know, it's really fun. I can remember the exact feeling / time. I don't know the exact date when you know, my you know, I when I was a kid like I love random things dinosaur space and I wanted to be like, you know an astronaut paleontology store. However, I'd like geeky stuff it maybe that's a common thing. I like is love science and technology because young and excited when I school so I went to La Salle Jebel.
4:  It's crazy because a lot of Filipino startups look up to you as one of the four founders of what it is right then back in 2011 2012. That's where the real startup movement other prior to that. There were a lot of you know here and there there's companies we call it internet companies but it's really solidified when idea space where was born Kickstart was born it is just steamrolled from there and let's just track back a little bit. So right now you're wearing three three main buckets, let's I mean three main  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so
5:  Kle engineering classes and even now, you know, it's not just about stem Fields. It's also in business, you know incorporate in general manufacturing. I think we're always, you know minority and I think now even in meeting sometimes, you know, how time one out of two in a meeting of you know, 20 or you know, just just generally always the minority. So I think it's just learning to to know that you have a spot.  In that meeting and know that you have a voice and I think you know companies are shifting to do a lot of diversity and inclusion, which has definitely helped a lot and I think we have some ways to go but I think we're definitely going in the right direction. So what do you think that you're doing? And what other people can do to kind of help make that better?
6:  With taking away women's rights with like oppressing so many other people how do we as a community give equal voice to men and women it's tough and I talked about this a lot because I'm an I love technology and I'm a big proponent of it and I think that for the first time we're in an age where we could have a true democracy where we could have an equal vote where we could really hear the voice of the people.  People it's still skewed because of media and news outlets and like you're not getting all the news all the time, but it's coming fast because of situations like Rin now and like, you know, I have a really hard time pinning it on one person in charge when it's a bunch of people that got him there. And so I tend to think like hey, why don't we do a self inventory and really think about why our actions ended up in
7:  Ring one and empowering the other and then pushing one up and one down by the whole feminist. I hate men movement drives me fucking insane because it's like that's not getting you anywhere. Yeah, like not all men are the same. They're just not like just like not all women are the same like certain people do shitty things regardless of who you are and what you know gender you are. So how do you think Society can take that and I mean just thinking like us were in a shit. Oh right now,  With taking away women's rights with like oppressing so many other people how do we as a community give equal voice to men and women it's tough and I talked about this a lot because I'm an I love technology and I'm a big proponent of it and I think that for the first time we're in an age where we could have a true democracy where we could have an equal vote where we could really hear the voice of the people.
8:  Data science or different kind of modeling or like technical jobs that need a lot of research and a lot of Education and Training and like to put in a certain way like state-of-the-art or Cutting Edge technology. They're doing it here and I think they do it here because they know the talent is in Tel Aviv, and the people study really hard here for that and and Israel. Yeah, especially Israel puts a lot of effort in  in and helps the people a lot to study this kind of thing. It's like really promoted by the by the state and by the companies and yeah, I'm like something culture itself, right? I mean everyone you talk to a boy or a girl like on the young ages. They already know they are kind they think mean they are already interested in this kind of field. Yeah. I'm going to go study what's gonna happen when I finish the army, of course, I'm going to study mathematics and computer science. Yeah. It's something that is very like in the society right now, and it's
9:  Again, more of his story coming out in other words. I'm not talking to any women. I'm not asking any women out because they're probably not going to like me anyway, so I'm not even open my mouth and even let a girl know I'm interested.  So instead you're acting like a woman and insecure shy woman.
 
Topic 19 ai in healthcare: How can artificial intelligence be used to improve healthcare outcomes?  What are some example uses of AI in healthcare?  News reports are relevant, as is speculation from thought leaders in tech and healthcare.
0:  The makers of AI to get in touch with their end users and really create the humbleness around it because it needs the humbleness from both sides. The AI industry cannot stiff-armed Healthcare and Healthcare cannot just rejected because at the stage where it is now, so we think this is very important and ideas also come from I mean 20 years in the industry knowing how and knowing how hard it is.  To drive confidence and Adoption of new technology and AI is it's a hugely and it goes straight into the core of what Radiology does and I mean I saw no, I never saw a technology that just went straight into to production of of of anything in healthcare. So we want to help both sides in creating this
1:  Color and in our communities caring for us those Health outcomes improve significantly. And so of course, there are other reasons for these poor health outcomes, but one of the solutions is diversifying the healthcare Workforce. And so that is one reason why I'm so passionate about this particular issue and why I wanted to start my company advancing Health Equity and so in my company I do  I give talks and trainings to healthcare institutions and Healthcare organizations. For example today. I'm actually flying to Buffalo to do a training for New York state with their family planning providers around unconscious bias and how it can influence how they communicate and make decisions about their patients. And so this is one of the reasons why I wanted to start my own my own company was that I can actually feel empowered to be addressing the
2:  We want to create a place where the human and the Machine can interact and the this this I mean on the results permissions can be discussed by humans and maybe maybe also vice versa. So the concept of you know, when when you're uncertain about the result of a machine, how did with that? How do you order the machine over time? How how do you enable the  The makers of AI to get in touch with their end users and really create the humbleness around it because it needs the humbleness from both sides. The AI industry cannot stiff-armed Healthcare and Healthcare cannot just rejected because at the stage where it is now, so we think this is very important and ideas also come from I mean 20 years in the industry knowing how and knowing how hard it is.
3:  Pain, I think in the process and you know that were there to get the pain and then find out what happens in terms of the the tech and there's a lot of aii around. I don't know how well you diligence is being done not on many of them and how deep that AI is at the moment but AI takes that many years to become fruitful and you know really deep and most of it's not there yet, and it's  About having that patient Capital to see that come to life and for investors to do much better due diligence on what AI actually is in healthcare and which ones are worth backing but I think it's going to take a lot of time and we're not there yet, even though there's lots of money going in that direction. So yeah, it's a confusing it's filled with lots of opportunities. There's lots of things, you know, lots of companies around this just
4:  Be made. Yeah and hard work are n but you know, I never forget an entrepreneur. It's definitely a lot harder at their end to get through and what's most concerning is the speed of healthcare sales is extremely slow PC fast. The two of them are not necessarily good bed makes so how that works. How is yet to be discovered but it there's yeah. There's going to be a lot of  Pain, I think in the process and you know that were there to get the pain and then find out what happens in terms of the the tech and there's a lot of aii around. I don't know how well you diligence is being done not on many of them and how deep that AI is at the moment but AI takes that many years to become fruitful and you know really deep and most of it's not there yet, and it's
5:  He delivers entire end-to-end Health Technology Solutions that support better outcomes and experiences for their customers at lower cost. So yawns of former Hospital CEO. He's a professor of Pediatrics. He's an expert on digital Innovation. And he's got a huge amount of expertise and data management AI Precision medicine tele-health Advanced Home Care everything you'd kind of need to run something like the medical officer Phillips.  so he's the head spoke to person as well for what Phillips calling a future health index, which is a yearly study which looks at various Healthcare professionals and general populations in 15 different countries and determines how ready they are to address Global health challenges and build sustainable Health Systems and on the podcast we talked about that report was about some of the interesting findings of that report the likes of China Russia Saudi Arabia being almost example as for health
6:  Large amounts of data, but they don't have the technical skills the process that so I just thought I needed that space and I wanted to be part of it and it's been my passion ever since then just dig in my old. I've been just the more I read about it the more questions I've become about it and he has just recently I went to in the video conference and even the video this started a whole Healthcare, which was really fascinating. They started a Clairol platform. So it's going to be specialized for hospital so they can offer.  In deep learning platform for hospital. So that's something that I want to be part of as well that resolution kind of bring health care and Hospital bring them up to speed for AI and positions and bring them up to speed great. And why did you say that having kids made you more interested to work in healthcare? I think there's a lot of things I did. You become a more compassionate human being if you probably know when you don't have kids you probably thinking only about yourself and then when your side did you go through the whole process?
7:  To drive confidence and Adoption of new technology and AI is it's a hugely and it goes straight into the core of what Radiology does and I mean I saw no, I never saw a technology that just went straight into to production of of of anything in healthcare. So we want to help both sides in creating this  Yes, but they get to get things a bit more clear. If I is it correct that now your radiologist abling working in your platform or the experts. Let's say they are able to use tools AI tools that you are providing or how should I see it? Mmm. So we do collaborations done with the AI industry where we say that we can act as your service tool or monitor tool if you like where you
8:  Figured yeah, I think I mean certainly in my practice. I do I work in general practice and help out with those asthmatics particularly who have had an asthma attack. And obviously the guidelines are very relevant to my practice and and I think a lot of my peers will immediately think of the five steps, you know, that's become ubiquitous in and ask much treatment. So so that alone is is a really really huge achievement in my in my  View and to get something that cuts through maybe doesn't cut through to the sort of non Healthcare professional mainstream, but it certainly cuts through to the healthcare professional mainstream. So it's it's a great achievement really there is actually an addition which is for patients. So we try and reach as wide an audience as possible. I think it's important to let people know what they should expect of their Healthcare professionals as well. As you know informing ourselves as clinicians.
9:  Our country now this year we did 15 indeed 15 countries and we send out a survey to a to approximately 2,500 to 3,000 individuals in every country as well as three on the 350 Healthcare Professionals in that country and we tried this year to understand how digitalization is influencing the relation between doctors and patients.  In the office in the hospital and also when the patients are back at home and there are three big messages that came out of the report and there are some differences in the countries, but the three things that that came up very clearly in almost all the countries was first of all that doctors and other Healthcare professionals are increasingly comfortable with digital tools.
 
Topic 20 cost of childcare: I’m looking for personal stories from people that have had to deal with increasing childcare costs.  How did they manage?  What was the effect on their lives?  Reports about average increases in childcare costs are not relevant unless they include quotes from individuals about their experiences.
0:  You realize very quick. It's much easier to keep existing customers happy and increasing this lifetime customer value or at least maintaining the average versus constantly trying to go out and get new clients because advertising it can be expensive and I say expensive. I do want to kind of deviate really quick and do another topic. I'm going to mention this  throughout the podcast this idea of advertising cost and it doesn't always necessarily mean just the cost of
1:  You don't want to think about that. Yeah, and that be and nappies but say there will be a window in a life cycle where you will purchase that product. So for example from the birth of her first child through to the age of the youngest child sort of graduating out of that could be a period of five to ten years that a family will be in the market for that. So at some point that market ages and you've got to replace that market, so I'm sure that there will be some  in Zed people that will have children for example, and that they will become a target market as their life cycle enters in that sort of age range of being appropriate for a certain category because in some categories you fully replace your customers. You don't have them for Life say like maybe a mortgage company or home insurance might have you for decades. Whereas something like baby products or childcare or things like that are very sort of short-term their 5.
2:  But I remember one of my mentors telling me hey Mike. Listen, if you're going to invest in real estate it cost the same amount of money to get somebody out and check out, you know, it cost the same amount of dollars per hour to get somebody to check out an AC unit at a million-dollar home as it is as a $75,000 duplex, right? It's the same cost per hour. So what I would say is, you know to be in front of somebody who wants to sell their home it cost you the same amount of money to be in front of somebody let's say with this.  The cost of a postage right? It's the same amount of money to get their attention with the postcard because you know, a postcard ten-million-dollar home costs the same as a postcard to 50,000 or home or a hundred thousand road. So for me if it were me I would actually start with the neighborhood in the reason why is because you get to control that that cost to acquire a customer or what that opportunity is meaning if I know that I'm going to spend money and I know the average transaction price and the average what I would be
3:  in Zed people that will have children for example, and that they will become a target market as their life cycle enters in that sort of age range of being appropriate for a certain category because in some categories you fully replace your customers. You don't have them for Life say like maybe a mortgage company or home insurance might have you for decades. Whereas something like baby products or childcare or things like that are very sort of short-term their 5.  Ten years, but is it is this something that is there any particular brand or markets on the top of your head that has kind of like a tiger Market from start of life to end of my conside banking? Yeah, because that's you know, people need finance and payment and you see the bank's now appealing. I don't know if you've seen the wearable, you know the pay we're so caps and little chips and Rings the Halo ring that you're like a paywave god.
4: We're here in the middle of the African Savanna on Safari looking for Mike. It's about a lion stalking us. I think it's something much scarier.  It's a search term report and someone has keywords with a hundred fifty percent a cost. Oh, no, never added any negative keywords side. It looks like all their bids are just three dollars no-bid optimization. We're in trouble we need to do something about this giant a cost, but I don't know if we can do it alone. Oh, no, it's the adventure. Should we run? No, no, no.
5:  As I'll go back to this keyword tool here. This gives us a general idea of the cost per click for for some of these Search terms and you can see roughly on average. You're probably looking at about a $2 per click cost. What we don't know is the conversion rate of this. So let's say you had a total of let's just say it's two dollars and fifty.  Sense and you were to get 10 clicks. So you spend $25. If one of those 10 clicks to your website converted they became a customer. Is that worth it, you know, so are you can you spend $25 to pick up a can acquire a new customer?
6:  I said there's a million other things I could talk about. But I think I gave some good advice. Hopefully that is basically free. The only thing I'll add.  As I'll go back to this keyword tool here. This gives us a general idea of the cost per click for for some of these Search terms and you can see roughly on average. You're probably looking at about a $2 per click cost. What we don't know is the conversion rate of this. So let's say you had a total of let's just say it's two dollars and fifty.
7:  on the bottom of this board. Yep, Jason to each other so cost structure. This is the physical cost the monetary value it takes for you to run your business simple as that and then we've got we've got fixed costs and variable costs, which I don't think it gets into on the document but it's what to think about as in for you to be in business without making any Revenue. What is it going to cost you so example with let's just say we're a two-person company mean, uh, we get no clients the cost of this business are going to be  Hosting for our website that we've got up as an example if we've got a salary that we take regardless of whether we're in a business that is a cost to the business variable cost look at stuff like marketing. So one week and our marketing on and off we also have cost of goods sold. So you only have to worry about costs of goods sold. So let's say we make a physical product and to make that product and I'm looking around my so I've got this weird duck. We're so we sell these ducks now H me and you
8:  Purrs, where is a competition within our trainers is like the person who does the best well moment in a month and you submit your while moments and it's documented they go above and beyond I don't care if he takes on out for coffee. You send some ubereats at the hospital because they're sick. I really don't care how you create. Wow moments. Create a wow moment. Okay, and then submit it in them the person who creates the best well moment inside your gym. They get a voucher. So it's like he's a pair of shoes good pair of shoes away every single month to the coach that creates the best while moment might cost you.  Box fill the silence like five. Wow moments going left, right and Center your full coaches 20 while moments a month that's increasing your customer experience. Remember, does it cost five to seven times more to get a new customer? So by giving him 200 bucks a pair of shoes or $150 per hour by met cons or something like that like that's going to increase your customer experience because you coach is going above and beyond now, I think wow moments is something that we can all Implement and really doesn't cost much at all and you're keeping clients for longer. You don't need to get more clients and also if you're creating
9:  Hosting for our website that we've got up as an example if we've got a salary that we take regardless of whether we're in a business that is a cost to the business variable cost look at stuff like marketing. So one week and our marketing on and off we also have cost of goods sold. So you only have to worry about costs of goods sold. So let's say we make a physical product and to make that product and I'm looking around my so I've got this weird duck. We're so we sell these ducks now H me and you  and it it costs us just drop the dough Trillium. It costs us a pound to make it in materials. That's a variable cost because we only pay that pound when we sell it. Okay, so there the different cost structures and you have to think about stuff like the legal cost structures. Is there any stuff that you need to go through patents and shareholders agreements insurances think about all the costs it takes for you to keep the lights on in your business anything. You've got front of you. Yeah. I've got some quite interesting bits actually. So we've
 
Topic 21 juneteenth: What does Juneteenth mean to people in the US? How do individuals feel about it, celebrate it, experience it? What are their thoughts and feelings about Juneteenth? Factual explanations of what Juneteenth is are not relevant.
0:  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we  Use that to answer, you know, it would look at it. I mean you by being an individual you're also a member of the community by just being yourself because you have your own experience that you're bringing to America and then that's not quite clear what I'm trying to say. It's pretty much I think what American literature is
1:  Individuality of many people everybody reading it me the song of myself the song of everybody reading it but it's essentially what we kind of talked about and we know we're in relating this back to Henry David Thoreau talking about you know, how to be your individual and how I raised the question of you know, the individual versus Community. I think that question about the individual is kind of Aunt  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we
2:  Is something that I think is more physically is more relevant to me. So I feel like I like if something's wrong or you know, if I'm physically in some sort of pain or the something we're going with it's hard for me to pick up on it. But for you, it's also relevant because obviously people can tell what emotions they're feeling or if they're feeling nervous or anxious or worried or that kind of thing. And and that's where I think is relevant for you because  Of a weird disconnect for that at all where you can't tell that something's bothering you you did it. Actually not that long ago. I mean I'm going to start with you anyway, but Sarah, I know I mentioned me first but you know, that's not what here we go. Okay, just because I've just thought of an example of you as I remember. It was like a few days ago. You were doing something. No you weren't you were we were just knocking about and you kind of just like hamburger in why my burger and I'm Burger.
3:  Close to the publishing date as possible. Just so that it's more relevant because even though this interview was done a few weeks ago. I like having the intro be done as close to when it goes up. Just so it's more relevant to my life. Like I want to tell you guys then my I'm in Miami and you guys are like, oh, yeah. I know that because I follow you on Instagram, you know. Anyways, I also wanted to thank you guys for the reviews that you guys have been giving this podcast, and if you guys have not yet given this a review, please please please do that and if you guys do  That DM it to me just so I can personally thank you because I think that just means so much to me and it's a really great way of kind of showing how you guys are feeling about the podcast because unlike YouTube. You can't comment on individual episodes, you know, so giving it a review is just really really helpful and that would just mean so much to me and in order to say my thanks. I wanted to shout out a reviewer of the week. So this reviewer of the week is Sophie and she said I just started listening to this podcast and it's hands down my favorite at the moment. I love the
4:  Doing them like I'm looking at them and then which ones were going to talk about now, which one's need to do bit more like looking into? Yeah, and this week's episode somebody mentioned about talking about the body and not I suppose like it is how you feel physically, but it's like how in touch with your own body you are as somebody on the spectrum because obviously there is that slight disconnection, especially I mean, I experienced it where you are unaware of, you know, I suppose what your body's trying to tell you now this  Is something that I think is more physically is more relevant to me. So I feel like I like if something's wrong or you know, if I'm physically in some sort of pain or the something we're going with it's hard for me to pick up on it. But for you, it's also relevant because obviously people can tell what emotions they're feeling or if they're feeling nervous or anxious or worried or that kind of thing. And and that's where I think is relevant for you because
5:  Saying no so that your Yes means something.  But also saying no without needing to explain yourself. No, I don't want to go to the movies because I need to do this or need to do that or not feeling this or I'm not feeling that and we ramble on with explanation or validation trying to give reason or
6:  Reason why is because I've learned to help others celebrate and I'm not that good at helping myself celebrate and I'm willing to take the criticism now the before I didn't always take I'm willing now to take the criticism of she's showboating. She's arrogant. She's blank blank blank. I'm willing to take that now because for my Human Experience I play a sport and I want to dance in the end zone and now I'm starting to  First and The Human Experience. It's just okay for people to continue to kind of be little or discourage you because they're trying to make you feel alone in that thought. They're trying to make you feel like you're the only person that is celebrating in your sport and you should feel bad about it. And it's that same isolation that's going to keep you from education. The minute they can isolate is the minute you turn away from your education and the minute you turn away from educating yourself is the minute that someone else controls your life.
7:  Is on August 1st, so I know I'm kind of getting into this early but Lamas is about completion. So this is kind of one of those holidays that if you want to celebrate it, it's kind of important to get a head start on it. So you're not, you know feeling like you're rushed last minute to celebrate it. So I thought I'd go ahead and do a podcast on it. So that way you guys can get an idea of what Lamas is if it's something that you would want to  Celebrate so to get into it Lamas is about celebrating the end of summer. It's about the Harvest coming up. It's on August 1st. And I know it's all pretty soon as summer here in Charleston. I can assure you that summer will not be over until November at least but the whole point of the holiday is to reflect on past accomplishments and look at
8:  Know if Christmas stresses you out if being at home with your family stresses you out. I want to remind you that you truly don't have to do that. And I don't mean Christmas with the Kranks style of just like not celebrating because I've tried that and I don't really think that works. If you do celebrate Christmas, of course, this is all in the tone of if you do celebrate Christmas, I never want to come across as offensive. I do my best to  Be not be offencive. So I think just having that realization of like okay, someone might get their feelings hurt. Okay, you know, some people might not like that you're not there and might have opinions about it. But if that if that like if you really don't feel good being there or you really want to avoid that situation like you have the choice to do that. I think we forget a lot about the control that we do have and I think that if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing it really would be that I have so much more control than I thought.
9:  She goes you're putting up a wall to prevent her. She said I was putting up a wall to prevent her from seeing me emotionally and she goes and that's what you're doing and all of these relationships and I was like, huh? I don't know digging up a wall for them to so they prevent her from seeing me emotionally. She goes my feelings and my thoughts are at odds right now. And then she goes my remedy for my feelings is to do something. So I'm not  To go into too much detail because I don't know who listens to podcasts that this is relevant to but basically I'm feeling some type of way about a situation and some you haven't talked to me about cuz I don't know what you talking. I know this is got me really confused. I'm feeling a I know and the reason that I haven't talked to you about it is because I'm embarrassed for feeling the way that I feel and she was asking me like, why are you embarrassed and she was talking to me about my relationship?
 
Topic 22 chernobyl hbo: The series Chernobyl aired on HBO in 2019.  What were people saying about it in podcasts?  I am especially interested in discussions about how events depicted in the show differed from reality.
0:  I'm unique in this office. I have a much longer commute than most people For Better or Worse most times worse. So I listen to a lot of podcast namely right now. I'm listening to One called critical role. It's a podcast about Dungeons and Dragons. We're a bunch of voice actors play it I listen to a design podcast weekly called 99% visible a comedy podcast called my brother my brother and me. I mean the list goes on and on and on but that's just kind of The Stereotype box that I'm trying to check.  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.
1:  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.  Always I'm catching up with season three. That's a really great one. Oh there I mean there's some episodes of the Conan podcast that like have me in tears. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, honestly. Yeah, I don't I don't think that's kind of there. Is this there is this one episode of Thomas middleditch and Schwartz that like killed me and then film spottings kind of a go-to that was like the first podcast I ever started listening to regularly. So awesome. Well, it's read more about Patrick and Kyle's trend of podcast as digital test Labs as well as our other.
2:  Well, that's not saying much. I did hear that Game of Thrones had a very shitty ending.  Well HBO, what the heck? What's up with all these terrible series finale thinking of HBO. I'm watching Barry now. It's fantastic. Sorry. This is so Random was very is so good. Um, okay. So let's wrap up about this and then let's talk about our specials are segments and our news and all of that. But this was this was such a good show. I have so much to say no. I honestly even though the series finale disappointed me I can say I'm very sad to see the show and and
3:  Comments. We love to hear what you guys think about the episode and also be able to engage with you live. So thank you for supporting us and keep watching and if I could say something about this this show and I was commenting on Chernobyl if you're one of the early adopters, so to speak it's time to get your friends watching it and watching this because then there's way more to talk about and I think over the next few weeks there should be a lot of deep great important discussions about the show, right? I think also when you do a mini series in this style where it's once a week  You know, I mean, look it's a five-part miniseries. You could very well have run it Monday through Friday and I think it tends to build because people are talking about other watching it. It's very easy to get caught up when you have a whole week between episodes. So I do think that the you know, the conversation is just going to grow and we appreciate we had quite a few people who watched our first show. So we thank everybody for being a part of that. I want to move on to a very significant character who is introduced in this episode Lana coma
4:  I like that. I think the one thing we just got human mind is this is in May so we have a lot of money right for DC Universe to make some announcements about how hey maybe we're merging or we're going to give you a credit like you're going to have HBO Max for this much time. So I it is really confusing right now, but we are a few months out. I keep thinking that this is coming out the same time as Disney plus Apple, it's all that but it's really it's in May right? I think that was a smart move on their part to push it. It is smart, especially because this next piece of news is that  that HBO Max is expected to produce major DCU films. So we're talking huge films here Mike as our Green Lantern in his room. I'm curious. Do you feel like what this is talking about with major films that we are going to launch characters in the DC Universe app or HBO Max app like Green Lantern and then have films also on the HBO Max or do you think that we're talking about characters that have nothing to do with HBO Max and just developing.
5:  The show will be available for 90 days on HBO Max before becoming available on RoosterTeeth Subscription Service, the half-hour dystopian series set 50 years in the future where an authoritarian Force threatens to conquer the world more news on when HBO Max is coming to Australia. Hopefully in the future. The CW is gearing up for the end of their hit show The 100 fortunately fans of the series can hold onto his sliver of Hope as the network are planning a backdoor pilot for a prequel series.  Freeze the show will be set 97 years before the events of the 100 and starts with the end of the world. The apocalypse Survivor Series will show up later this season as a flashback episode and based on reception could fuel the new series forward to Pilot We will of course keep you posted The Last of Us 2 has been delayed again. The game was due to release in February 20 20, and now the game Studio Naughty Dog confirmed. It needs more time to complete the game. The new release date is May 29.
6:  Volunteering I'm going to stay on this side of the desk. All right, I'll take it over. But okay guys before we move into our next topic here. We just want to say first of all, thank you so much for making us the ESPN of TV talk and we need your help for us to be able to continue to grow here at AfterBuzz TV, please please make sure you subscribe to us on YouTube.

7:  fans of the series and it's also spawned I think the movie spawned video games and there's also a motion series that was part of it but diving into the TV to adaptation from HBO. So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the  Creator and showrunner for lost which was one of my favorite shows. I remember racing home when I was in high school to go and see like what happened. I'm lost except to like the later Seasons when it kind of died off and he's been a showrunner and kind of a person in in the industry for a while and the series being developed by him. It's been likened to like a reboot of the series but not really it's like also like a 34 years in the future, so it's not dealing
8:  Since it came out it was a best-selling Series. So there was a lot of people who are optioning it for movies TV shows. I think there's a lot of stuff that's been in the works. I think but famously in the last 10 years in 2009 director stack Snyder of the 300 Fame developed that that the Watchman into a movie and this was kind of a lukewarm movie didn't do great at the bottom box office did okay, but it was also very polarizing reaction from the  fans of the series and it's also spawned I think the movie spawned video games and there's also a motion series that was part of it but diving into the TV to adaptation from HBO. So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the

Topic 23 notre dame fire: The 2019 fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris personally affected many people around the world.  I’m looking for episodes of podcasts with people talking about how it affected them, how they felt about it, their personal recollections of visiting Notre Dame or otherwise experiencing Notre Dame in some way.  Factual information about the fire or about the cleaning and reconstruction effort are not relevant.
0:  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.  It was the most magical music and the people who would walk by in the morning would often stop for a moment or two to listen to The Sounds rising out of the Old Stone building not many people noticed. But if you listen closely, you would actually hear more than just the choir singing inside. There is also another noise that rose out of Notre Dame. It was a beautiful sound as well full of humming.
1:  It was a crisp cool morning in the beautiful city of Paris people sip their hot coffees and nibbled on their freshly baked baguettes in the cafes. They walked along narrow roads and over beautiful stone Bridges going to work or simply enjoying the city.  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.
2:  Some other tragic news over the weekend related to Notre Dame is the arrest of land and bartilson the defensive back from Kentucky. That would have been coming in in June. He is not going to be coming to Notre Dame arrested with a couple others.  Stolen vehicle stolen Firearms. I'm not sure what all else is involved, but he will not be playing football for Notre Dame. Yeah, I mean, so it was less than 20 less than 24 hours before Notre Dame was basically cut ties with bartilson. I'm he's the only decision to make and they made it quickly. I guess I'm shocked in some ways that this happened and this singular instance, but also in some way surprised that Notre Dame has not
3: Live I know that there's not much chance of them getting the playoffs but I just did a thing this morning about this would be five years of the last six heading into know which Brian Kelly has remained as had one loss or less going into November. So there's some significance of that guys. What are your thoughts on the line moving the way did well we thought the four and a half was Askew one-and-a-half made sense. And I want one by Notre Dame would have made sense to I you know, this usually late money is dumb.  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.
4:  Line stood on the edge of her house and took a deep breath. She couldn't believe this was it. She was about to fly to the Notre Dame and try out for Lim yet judges. She puffed her feathers and jumped off spreading her wings and turning in the direction of the Notre Dame Madeline looked down at the winding streets of Paris as she flew and felt excited and nervous all at the same time. This was it this was the day she'd been waiting for for so long  She had spent so much time practicing so much time dreaming. What would it feel like to finally sing for the judges at Lem yet? Would she be good enough? Would they choose her? She had been practicing for so long finally as she was thinking of these things. She saw Notre Dame in the distant as she got closer. She saw that all the pigeons were entering inside the building through a little hole in the top of the
5:  C glow about them. Yeah, it's just a bad football team the whole I guess I can't stress enough the people that the bottom half the SEC sucks. And if that's all tournament, it's the bottom half of the other P5 conferences. They'd get skunked. Yeah. Well, I mean the whole SEC narrative is ridiculous. I saw SportsCenter guy after Notre Dame was just blown out by Georgia man. That was such an ass kicking. Oh what a minute Notre Dame was driving to win that thing in lost by 6 that if you didn't take Notre Dame in the points on that, you know,  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the
6:  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.  She can being favored by one and a half two and a half something like that like sort of less than a field goal or right? Right, but nobody make favors is surprised because I think the great Timber a former Clemson SSID Notre Dame graduate said tweeted out that the last eight night games in the series. The home team is eight. No, I mean that would sort of lead you to believe that Michigan should be sort of a slight favorite in this game, but I think the better I don't buy that again.
7:  Yeah, but I think Texas is The Only Name that makes people think hey, let's tune and ESPN leading into the playoffs the Texas Notre Dame would be pretty happy about it as well. That's true. But yeah that because the lack of recognition of bullet is going to be disappointment. I knew and I both said watching Stanford, this is a Citrus Bowl quality Team Notre Dame Notre Dame Notre Dame. They are at least that they're deserve better than the camping Bowl this one time Candy World Bowl, but they're not going to probably get it. I don't know. I think they would  What do you think you deserve to your six? I think nobody could win two years six ball depending on the opponent, but they're at least a Citrus Bowl level team is kind of how we're looking at it at that moment there and I actually meant to go and I will do this at some point maybe put on our message board are there are ten and two teams that don't get into your sixth a bowl now. I don't know what snorting going to be the only one this year. I that that maybe that's not true. No, not at all. I mean I'm power among power five conference has oh, but that it but it's happened before.
8:  Stolen vehicle stolen Firearms. I'm not sure what all else is involved, but he will not be playing football for Notre Dame. Yeah, I mean, so it was less than 20 less than 24 hours before Notre Dame was basically cut ties with bartilson. I'm he's the only decision to make and they made it quickly. I guess I'm shocked in some ways that this happened and this singular instance, but also in some way surprised that Notre Dame has not  Because it's college football and you're dealing with 85 young people who make dumb decisions sometimes like it's been a while since Notre Dame is sort of had the 2016. Yeah, and that Alton five four years is an eternity. It is in college sports to have dumb stuff like this happen. I mean, it's athletic tragedy for bartilson because you're throwing away like basically a you're closing off a door where your life could have gone because you made some really stupid decisions. It was yeah that
9:  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the  And after Georgia dismantled Notre Dame, it doesn't it's like you don't even have to watch the game or actually know what happened. You just want to run with your SEC narrative. And when you combine that with Notre Dame sucks and can't play division one team. Well, that's just a happy marriage, right? Unbelievable. Yeah, it's I'm happy to give credit where credit's due but the constant propping up and polishing of an imperfect product. Right really once you get past the Marquis teams, it pisses me off. I'm with you and Notre Dame played.
 
Topic 24 france yellow vest protests: What do people think were the causes of the yellow vest protests in Paris in 2019?  What topics in politics and economics did people touch on when they talked about the protests?  News stories about the protests are not relevant.
0:  This is the time when students are coming out with junks people are raising their voices when we are saying that India is going to be super power 2020 that is average age of all. The people in the in India is going to be 29 years. That is the most amount of Youth in our country and still you think that we should be blindly sitting and supporting whatever the government is getting us.  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi
1:  Rammed with this news out to everybody else. And then they almost it's almost like gets to a point where I think people are you say create that your I mean like it's like that whole thing. I'll go and buy yellow car because no one's got one and then I drive it off the forecourt and everyone's got a yellow car. Is that kind of thing, isn't it? Like as soon as it comes into your Consciousness? That's what you see. I like the weather for what you call it the weather at the end of the news.  Is never accurate No No, but someone is the most accurate part of news if there is any accurate for sports sports. Hopefully I just believe if we blame people for the bad stuff. We also have to blame them for the good stuff. Yeah, one thing that popped up to my mind was Placebo. Hmm. We talked about thoughts. Mmm.
2:  Those were not students and this has been confirmed by the police itself Delhi police arrested 10 students for violence and out of or tends to saying that those were 10 students, but when it was found out those were not the students but some locals who were judge who got involved in this protest and the middle for their benefit.  I'm not saying that protest might not go wrong. They might but it doesn't mean that we have to stop protesting.
3:  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi  I was ordered to Lottie what was ordered to encourage that he charged now a lot of you might also say that Delhi police did it it's nothing about our government our leader or our prime minister. Let me tell you how the leap on this works then leap police is not under anybody's control except the home minister of our country. Not even the state government.
4:  Everyone, please. Welcome our second. Guess Harry laycock.  So Harry, what will be the most plausible outcomes to come from the protests? Well based on my research. I found three plausible outcomes the most plausible outcomes of all of these is that the authorities will wait out the protesters to avoid a Not to cause a nonviolent approach. So what Research indicates this way? Well, I think the main reason for this is being the most possible outcome is because both the Hong Kong and Chinese government's don't want to have on have the need to end of intervene directly.
5:  It's something but it actually nothing, you know protest against it was saying it was just a novelty and I do genuinely think they did care about the environment and thought they cared about the our own but in real life no one else it came across from all perspectives as a joke. Well, I spoke to me weren't joking. No, they weren't joking about about the perspective of everyone else on based or as a joke and wasn't as a joke. Yeah. It was it literally was a joke. It was an excuse to Flap about for and you look at some of the ones up in London. Some people thought they were  do something good but some other links to London, how did I get to London? Some of them thought they were doing something good. Some of them are there for a laugh and some of them genuinely passionately cared someone at the majority of the Snapchat stories. I saw a guy at that London protest who climbs is quite funny actually climb the Victoria Monument outside Buckingham Palace and started waving the Soviet flag. They climbed up to the golden bit and started flying the flag thing is how else how do they get? How do those people get there? Yeah. I think a lot of people do it to say that they've been they would have they would have caused loads of traffic which is
6:  inflation may enable China's have palette intimidate or silence dissidence. This would also be a massive issue for freedom of media and freedom of speech. The first big protest was on the 9th of June where an estimated 1 million people marched the government headquarters to show they were against the proposed bill. So kind of sounds as if the protest for the starting to be peaceful. So, how did I become so violent? Well while this is a peaceful protest three days later police were firing tear gas and rubber bullets on the 15th of June the Hong Kong leader care.  I made a dramatic reversal and promised to indefinitely delay. The extradition Bill protest was with throwing bricks and petrol bombs back at police. And this is causing a massive issue in the city the next day 2 million were on the streets calling for the complete removal of the bill and Caroline's resignation many Saw hers beijing's puppet slowly cutting Hong Kong's freedoms in passing power to mainland China. So I heard some rumors about the Chinese government instigating fights and what moat can you clear that up?
7:  What are you trying to do? I don't understand what is wrong with this country right now firstly an illiterate leader is getting into the getting into the hostels in universities. I don't even know if he has ever seen those universities for his own benefit. This is something really stupid.  What now talking about these students protest a lot of morons would even say that wider students have to go and protest when they go to study in the universities. These students are not protesting for the purpose of violence. They are protesting for the purpose of spreading awareness.
8:  And I'm far from doing that. I'm reading news. I'm going through updates every single day. I'm trying to make myself as much rational as possible so that I'm not putting any wrong views in front. You need to understand that it's okay. We cannot do something on a large scale. It is not important to every time go out on the streets and show our faces for doing something we can do things behind the curtains.  And that we can do is spreading awareness. We can create more rational citizens in our country and which is the best solution to whatever is happening today. We need to understand that the weapon of protest right now is knowledge. We need to be as much knowledgeable on this topic as possible right now now.
9:  do something good but some other links to London, how did I get to London? Some of them thought they were doing something good. Some of them are there for a laugh and some of them genuinely passionately cared someone at the majority of the Snapchat stories. I saw a guy at that London protest who climbs is quite funny actually climb the Victoria Monument outside Buckingham Palace and started waving the Soviet flag. They climbed up to the golden bit and started flying the flag thing is how else how do they get? How do those people get there? Yeah. I think a lot of people do it to say that they've been they would have they would have caused loads of traffic which is  More fumes into the air and actually anything they probably the type worse. Hmm and the amount of usage on people's phones over there and actually the school protest that's even worse because you're shocking people from learning, you know, you might get Old Timmy who bit slow in his math class and he can't do is bet you can't concentrate because of the environment the same people are stopping at work and he can't knees got to do it's just people's incompetence of negotiating and actually using the art of talking and communicating.
 
Topic 25 black lives matter: What do people mean when they say “black lives matter”?  I am interested in personal reflections that give context to the phrase “black lives matter” and why it is important to individuals.  News stores about Black Lives Matter protests are relevant as well.
0:  Why it's such a big phrase such an important phrase in my life right now and has been for a really long time. But this episode I you know, I was doing a lot of thinking recently and I'm like there should also be a because I said, I wouldn't and I really want to dive into that and kind of explain what I mean by that and how you can start putting this phrase into your life as well. So because I said I would I'll just kind of briefly explain it you can go back to the first episode as well and  kind of hear a little bit more in depth, but it essentially means you know, whatever it is. You said you were going to do in your life no matter how big or small you do it because you said you would so there's some things like for example for me moving to California. I said since I was like 14 that I was going to move to California and I'm doing it because I said I would if I decided maybe now like now that it's getting really real maybe I shouldn't do this. Maybe it's too scary. I'm not doing what I said I would do and I would have regrets and I would not be living my life to the
1:  And now the fellow is building an incredible business because at the core of the experience of the customer, the client is trust commitment and care that's in the it's a commercial example. What about a personal example? What about a love example about a love relationship? What about our friendship? Well, that's the same they're just of course in different context, but when it comes to being with close friends people that we care about and love there has to be some kind of consistency there in terms of Who We Are  Saying what we put trying the values that we're demonstrating the values that we are living the values that we are expressing. You know, what we do in our lives in terms of our conversation pieces and the activities that we have, you know, all of that. So, you know, there is certain a certain element of consistency when it comes to trust, you know, you committed to Excellence well in the context of a marriage or a friendship or relationship, this is a reflection of the commitment that we have to the relationship no matter what I mean do
2:  Saying what we put trying the values that we're demonstrating the values that we are living the values that we are expressing. You know, what we do in our lives in terms of our conversation pieces and the activities that we have, you know, all of that. So, you know, there is certain a certain element of consistency when it comes to trust, you know, you committed to Excellence well in the context of a marriage or a friendship or relationship, this is a reflection of the commitment that we have to the relationship no matter what I mean do  We have that person's back when they need us the most. You know, how do we excuse me? How do we talk about that person when we're not with them do we talk about them in the same way that we talk about them when we're with them. Is there a consistency? Is there a commitment to that are we committed to our friendship or our friend? So in other words, you know our attitude and our mind and our energy and our Vibe about that person when they're not with us, is it the same as when we are with them?
3:  Success means I'm living a purposeful purposeful life a life that is driven by helping others and growing myself. So you will see there that I've Incorporated personal development within their I'm passionate about my work and it brings me abundance and freedom in my finances. I have freedom with how I choose to spend my time my health both mental and physical is at the top of its game and that's super important.  Portent for me because if I've ever truly going to be able to help people I have to be able to help me first and it's super important to me to be really authentic. I don't want to be ever telling anyone what to do. If I have never done it myself first. That's really not in alignment with my values and my measure of success is how I feel about me and how I turn up. My life is a reflection of my values.
4:  Matter, but here I am and it's all lace in that as me. Just ask you myself by every major decision I make is this going to benefit me today? And also the me 5 10 15 20 years from now and I hope you guys ask yourself the same. So those are my 36 life lessons for my 36th birthday, which is kicking off tomorrow, and I hope you guys enjoy them. I truly do and many times we get so caught up in our own little world we  Forget that life goes quick and we also forget you know, what's really important and what really matters most to us and most in life and I would urge you all to enjoy the journey because that's what it's all about. It's the laughs. It's the cries. It's the accomplishments and the failures and everything in between along the way that makes up our life. So when we die and that tombstones there and that - is going you know, 1983 until who the fuck knows when like what what did you feel?
5:  It really does matter to you know that you had a book that was in the library. You were a real person at my University that everyone who takes your classes tends to speak highly of them. You're like a real human being good to hear. It did have the character for me of reading thoughts that I had had my whole life but didn't know that you were allowed to say exactly so like when you don't know when you've never heard someone respectable say something.  You assume that there must be some reason you don't know exactly why for example, like the phrase Black Culture is unsayable. Right? Like there must be something you don't get but then you hear somebody say it somebody who clearly has good intentions is clearly intelligent and, you know, it can open things up for you and always I think it is important that that you wrote that book and thank you. Thank you.
6:  You know and it's interesting, you know, we live in a so-called Christian Nation that will change the Bible's, you know statements and and um, but will hold fast to you know, document written hundreds of years ago by some old white dudes. They don't have a context of what we're living in now, but you know plenty of people say like once when Sandy Hook happened nothing else matters once it was okay to mow down white kids that we know.  A else is safe. Like there's this country does they cares more about this this constitution this old Constitution that's not certain aspects of it is not relevant to what we're dealing with today, but that's more sacred than the lives of children and human beings today so that couple with the rhetoric from 45 like this is a you know, this is the situation that we find ourselves in now okay ray.
7:  How many cases we saw Mike Brown's Body we heard that the horrific videos of Trayvon screaming we saw can leave out as Road to Suicide. These are all because of white people and then aren't you saw Sandra Bland we saw because he's fucking white supremacist. And that's what they are. That's all they are. These are mad white supremacist because black lives do not matter we can hashtag it we can we can write we can storm Tottenham for Mark Duggan black lives. Do not fucking matter.  And that is why watching something like when they see us, so why do people educate yourselves educate yourself do better? Because when you know better you're going to do better. Also, I want even if you keep making care.
8:  And you're opening up new vendor relationships. So we've been fortunate enough where you know, we have a banking partner that cares about underserved communities and that's why we decided to work with them. We're actually looking to partner with black owned Banks and making our platform a source of distribution for assets for black owned Banks. You can hear more about that in 2020 from us, but when you're talking to a new vendor they say we'd like to see your credit score and if it doesn't meet a certain threshold, they will not do business and I can do business at all even  If you have the best idea in the World As a matter, it doesn't matter no matter how much money you got put away right that three digit number has prevented so many individuals to lose out on opportunities, which is why I say we have to get educated when it comes to credit and the thing about it is the credit score is not a reflection of who you are as a person at all. You are, you know, I fear a God-fearing person take care of your family responsible at home all that stuff you may have
9:  with black people when it comes to cannabis.  It is not. Okay is fine support the police go for you regulations where you little blue lives matter Blue Line bullshit at not good. Do you think that's fine? I get it. But let's be real blue lives is not a real thing blue eyes is a choice. I didn't have a choice being born black or being labeled as black. They threw that shit up on me. If you look at him. My skin is actually brown carpet on looks like a painting but

6:  To the motivation and intent of the defendants three others involved in the Watergate operation were not identified during the trial when they could have been by those testifying.  For almost a year Woodward and Bernstein had written countless words on the Watergate scandal each article chipping away at the seemingly impenetrable wall of Lies surrounding the White House Woodward was proud of the work he and his partner had done but he was well aware that it hadn't changed anything. But from the moment McCord's letter was read before the court. It was like a dam had burst open.

They had begun with Howard hunt Woodward left a meeting with a new Focus. If the creep employees wouldn't talk. He and Bernstein would have to try a new tactic.

Topic 27 civil rights protest stories: I’d like to hear stories about protests and protestors in the Civil Rights movement in the US in the 1960s.  Stories about individual experiences with protests; individuals’ motivations for protesting; how protests like the March on Washington came to be; the roots and foundations of the movement; etc; are all relevant.
0:  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi  I was ordered to Lottie what was ordered to encourage that he charged now a lot of you might also say that Delhi police did it it's nothing about our government our leader or our prime minister.

The people in the in India is going to be 29 years. That is the most amount of Youth in our country and still you think that we should be blindly sitting and supporting whatever the government is getting us.  We need to be well informed citizens.

4:  What now talking about these students protest a lot of morons would even say that wider students have to go and protest when they go to study in the universities. These students are not protesting for the purpose of violence. They are protesting for the purpose of spreading awareness.  If nobody is going to raise voice against what is happening in our country, the government will have the power to do whatever they want to which means we are ready to accept any Injustice coming our way. We accepted Kashmir. We accepted trance discrimination. We are now trying to accept citizenship Amendment bill.
5:  To like be more conscious about the environment like where do you even begin like top three things to do definitely educate yourself? Yeah, because a big issue is like people don't know how to defend themselves. And I think that's how you like Lou you kind of lose run of yourself while you're doing it in the first place so educate yourself but not to the point but not to your breaking point where you're like, I can't decide the only thing I can think about and it's really causing you anxiety. Like I'm at my point now where I know all the information I'm not going to read anything in. Yeah, we're about it because I already know and then secondly is  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.
6:  I'm very happy because I it's always so hard to hear the horror stories of people being you know, thrown out being yelled at being no, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're lucky in in the United States just in general, you know, it's hard to see it sometimes you know because there are issues that we do face here and I'm not saying that we don't but you know compared to all to other nations, you know, not all nations celebrate.  Lgbtqa people or even you know celebrate have a have a social event like pride in the way that we are able to hear. You know, the the first the first New York City Pride marches were protests, right? So, I mean the events have gone through metamorphosis. The way that people are accepting of other people is important that has gone through a change, you know, it's been by people.
7:  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.  The other day they like load of young people like took it over. I'm like it gives me so much hope because he'd be talking to your parents or things like that and they just like well like, you know, we've done this like we've lived half way through our lives, you know, like but seeing those sort of people gives me so much hope so finally like what gives you hope to carry on and like what gives you the drive to keep going with your work? I think I'm gonna like battle a little today, but I think the younger Generations are way more intelligent and compassionate.
8:  The foundation uses this section to backup all their data on both our current world and any worlds that came before all on microfilm.  Adam becomes curious about a computer that isn't functioning and opens it up. Despite Calvin's protest.
9:  Let him know you like people are just like I want a new way to buy and then as well those influencers and like people who genuinely want to make a difference. It's like you have to evolve now because I started with disable fashion. I started with the first of all it was veganism then sustainable fashion. And now I'm an activist. Yeah, like I want to organize protests. I'm organizing that poster Workshop. So like when people aren't evolving you're still staying within capitalism because you're just evolving within the capitalist culture. You're not actually evolving as an activist. Yeah, so I think a lot of  When I feel down and my boyfriend gives out to me about this as well. He's like you should be happy because like he was like you're never happy the weld upon it isn't saved yet. So I'm alone see annoyed by it and I just love to see more people because encouraging people to go out and protest but the paying with going out and protesting it doesn't benefit you as an influencer at all. Like you're not gonna pay for that. But if you're like this sustainable fashion thing is so Good by 20 Euro to see me talk about her somewhere. You know what I mean? You're getting paid for that.

3:  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a  Start to you know to sad introduction to diet culture. But as you're telling me I'm thinking this is like so many people that I see this is an I felt so alone at this point. I remember sitting on the couch going what is wrong with me? Why is if no one's talking about it. I believed that it didn't exist that there was some fundamental floor. Everyone else have willpower. I didn't and I blamed myself for a long time by the time I'm 17. I'm deeply unhappy. I'm deeply disappointed.
4:  This is where am I eating? Disorder was kind of, you know going full strength and it's you know, I reach the goal. Even when I go to my goal weight though. It wasn't as though I ever felt good enough. I always look to myself. Oh, you know, I could still lose weight and everyone around me thought yeah, you know, you could still lose weight and yet I was in a really Slim body or still not good enough. As soon as I stopped seeing this dietitian. I fell into binge eating so, you know, I knew everything I needed to do yet my body took control.  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a
5:  Strips away all of the bay s and just provides great nutrition information all from a non dieting perspective, which I love she's obviously very talented because she's able to get non dieting messages across in her role as the channel 9 Today Show dietitian, which I absolutely love. She's also the founder of the keep it real program. It's a program that we're going to talk a little bit more about later, but it's helping people get off the yo-yo diet cycle.  Overcome binge and emotional eating I've done the whole program myself and absolutely loved it.

I love each week. I'll share stories practical strategies and have inspiring conversations with guests to help you get and keep the body you dream of now, let's find out how to bring up with yo-yo dieting and fall in love.  With yourself. I was now nutrition and I wasn't eating that obviously led to me getting Cravings because when the body can sense that you are lacking in a main macronutrient or nutrients, it will send signals of hunger to tell you to keep eating until it's actually received but it's after this podcast is not meant to diagnose treat prevent or cure any medical or mental health condition. Please check with your Healthcare professional before making changes to your diet or exercise program. Hello everybody.
7:  I'm you know on my trust in my body on so many different levels. So yeah, so that was that was that I had this diagnosis this label of PCOS. That's who I was it meant that I was, you know fat but it meant that it was going to be difficult for me to lose weight and kind of the yo-yo dieting continued because they just said well, we'll put you on the pill that will regulate your Cycles which we really know that actually going on. The pill doesn't really do anything to your Cycles, but  But that was my treatments told me to lose weight if I went and that was it. So there ya go to guy yo-yo dieting continued as I was trying to lose the weight, but then putting it back on and then losing it put it back on and then it was I carried on with that. I went finish my school went to you needed the unique thing got a job and then it was when I was working my first kind of proper job in London that this horrific incident.
8:  Changing the environment creating some mindfulness and and figuring out some workable new behaviors, but then if it's one of those sort of off the cuff, hey, I just want to have the donut you just enjoy yourself. That's it. You go for gold. Enjoy Lindy. I got one more question when it comes to the how to's and I think this is one that's probably relevant for almost everyone. So Liz asks, how do you consistently stay healthy control your eating and portion?  Sizes and not diet but lose some stubborn fat. She says a healthy lifestyle is what I want. Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?
9:  Sizes and not diet but lose some stubborn fat. She says a healthy lifestyle is what I want. Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?  Great question and I think you're right. This does talk to what we were saying before. Okay, so I'm just going to give you some more healthy habits to give you some ideas or some little ways to just improve your health and it may have been qu8 in losing weight. So we know we talked about not having alcohol during the week. So that is one option. Another option is to increase your steps for the day, you know, some people find that have been a step cut counter can be controlling other people don't so just find if you're one of those people that you
 
Topic 29 racism in canada: How does racism appear in Canada?  I’m looking for personal anecdotes about peoples’ experiences with racism in Canada.  Research such as sociological research is relevant if reported on.
0:  Is the difference is he Embraces his conditioning and uses it for political purposes. So I call that a vowed racism and to the best of my ability. I am committed to challenging my racist conditioning and the reason why it's important for me to distinguish to make that difference clear is I don't think it's useful for me to position Trump as racist and me is not racing because that invokes what I think is probably the most  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and
1:  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and  Early intentional or if it is intentional. We're not going to admit to that right? So this this adaptation to make a racist really bad and you know, everybody else is good has made it virtually impossible to talk to the average white person about their racist conditions, right? And I think it's the root of all white defensiveness and I think that's what's happening when barbecue Becky is being told what you're doing is racist nice people and I'm sure she sees herself as a nice person can't all
2:  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.  So another another piece of evidence that white people often give is our minority status in another axis of social life. Right? And so the question that I would offer a white person who experiences oppression is somewhere else is what does racism look like in your community what a in particular anti-blackness look like in your community. What does anti-blackness look like?
3:  Offended when I discussion about racism occurs, so we look forward to doing what I believe is the Creator's will and that is for us to live this truth. Yes. I recognize that that is necessary in order to end racism. Could you begin by stating?  What your perspective is about the existence of racism? Oh talk about what what it is. Oh, I agree with the with the principal.
4:  She said don't get she said Miss move it all that. Oh, my best friend is black. So she's saying that she don't want to hear that. Wow shots fired shots fired stated that you're interested in solving this problem and ending racism in your view if the system of racism white supremacy is ended what benefits  people experience
5:  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.  Important to say actually let's go granular and let's say I'm going to break down what anti-blackness is and in our I want everyone to sign up to that review of even within the black community because a lot of black people are anti-black also, they believe many of the messages that have been, you know communicating to them. They don't trust other black business owners. They think they're every black man is a threat and it will cross the road when they see a black person in a
6:  basically saying you don't see that we are different in any way shape or form and if you may not be racist potentially your parents or your parents parents definitely held some extreme views because the times at that Arrow was more allowance or allow a allowing of that and so it just is we understand that it's a funnel. It was a very big funnel and now it's getting narrower and narrower and a group of people that believe that and but we still have it. So yeah that that that's what was really kind of sort of living on my mind and really  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.
7:  I am not racist, right and I want to challenge that and offer that niceness is not anti racism because niceness is not courageous. There's absolutely nothing Courageous about niceness anti-racism takes courage like incredible courage and risk and you are not actually always seeing as particularly nice when you  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.
8:  And it's sad that you have to change how you act and censor who you are because not everyone is okay with it. And it's sad because we live in Canada where I mean in most parts of Canada. I'd like to say in all of Canada you could walk down the street and at least feel comfortable being who you are. And if someone doesn't you as a Canadian field the right to kind of stand your ground or and if they if they make you feel otherwise then they don't belong  Canada because I think collectively yeah as a country were very proud of just us being a people and and we don't look at you know where you've immigrated from or anything. It's you are Canadian and and it doesn't matter about gender identity or sexuality so when we're blessed and when we travel to other places, I think that people often don't do enough research. Yeah, and it's important to do research because it might say that it's gay friendly online and and
9:  The theory the principle that racism is Prejudice first time. I had a conversation yesterday with a black man that and he said that he knew some of his people who were racist and and I talked with him about that because without the power  To take that prejudice and actively place it into position to cause people to do or not. Do hmm, then it is simply just Prejudice and and I believe that so that's the premise from which I come that racism. You have to have that power in order for there to be racism. Now. She said there must be
 
Topic 30 motherhood: I want to hear podcast episodes with new mothers relating and discussing their expectations and experiences for motherhood.  Stories, conversations, panel discussions are all relevant.  I’m not very interested in hearing from experienced mothers.
0:  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage. Now everyone who has experienced toxicity with their mothers has a different story. Sometimes the damage that is done is mild. Sometimes the damage is moderate and sometimes the damage is on a yalla yalla fix my life.  Life pstd level. So toxic motherhood in a nutshell is a mother a step mother a grandmother in Auntie or a primary caregiver who essentially does a very poor job at parenting some toxic mothers are controlling some toxics mothers can be the rating and hypocritical some text toxic mothers can be envious and jealous some toxic mother's compete with their daughters some toxic mother's work overtime.
1:  Glimpse of it. You take a snapshot line. And this is again. Like we're going to get into a big conversation about like body positivity through your body connectivity as a better word through motherhood the transition of into motherhood because that's like something I'm so fucking passionate about and that's like work I'ma blow your goddamn minds, but give yourself time. Give yourself time be gentle go slow be interested.  Curious. Yes be curious and get it with yourself before you bring in another human. Yep, right like we didn't really get it with yourself before you bring in another human in. This was my approach this time as well where I was very mindful in because I experienced prolapse this time around which is a whole new whole new fucking Terrain in the pussy department where I

3:  Bus for this video is not for the person who had the kind of mom who considers her children the heartbeat outside of her body. This video is not for the listener who plans on buying their mama Mansion when they make it this video is not for that kind of mom, but this video is for my listeners who have been damaged who have been neglected who are resentful of their mothers who have been misinformed about their worth from their mothers and this video is for women who have grown up with a  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage. Now everyone who has experienced toxicity with their mothers has a different story. Sometimes the damage that is done is mild. Sometimes the damage is moderate and sometimes the damage is on a yalla yalla fix my life.
4:  Life pstd level. So toxic motherhood in a nutshell is a mother a step mother a grandmother in Auntie or a primary caregiver who essentially does a very poor job at parenting some toxic mothers are controlling some toxics mothers can be the rating and hypocritical some text toxic mothers can be envious and jealous some toxic mother's compete with their daughters some toxic mother's work overtime.  I'm to chop the tree of your self-esteem down some toxic mothers will hurt your feelings and be Unapologetic about it. Now. I'm well aware that calling out women for being bad mothers is considered Blasphemous and sacrilegious in our society, but poor mothering is a real thing that affects millions of lives both men and women with toxic motherhood children are the victims with talk with toxic motherhood children.
5: Welcome to the motherhood simplified podcast. I'm your host Chris Lachlan and on the surface. I teach you how to declutter your home. So you can focus on what matters most to you as a mom, which I'm guessing isn't those laundry mountains dishes stacked in the sky and a tornado's you clean up all day. My hope for this podcast is so much more than teaching to declutter. I record all of my soda live and in real time so that you can have the experience of a mom. To get seen with Miss there for you. My audio isn't perfect. My kids might interrupt us but the conversations we have our real impactful and proof that there are other moms like you at the cluttering has worked for if you want to join me and thousands of other moms for live episodes opened us on Instagram and Facebook just search mother has simplified will welcome you with open arms. See you soon.
6:  this experience of motherhood has has been really fulfilling so far.  Motherhood sessions is a production of gimlet media. It's produced by Peter. Bresnan. Our editors are Devon Taylor and nausea and rafsanjani music and mixing by Emma. Monger will have a brand new episode next week. I'm 42. I'm a single mom. I intentionally, you know had a child on my own and so because of that there's just feel like like an other
7:  I'm to chop the tree of your self-esteem down some toxic mothers will hurt your feelings and be Unapologetic about it. Now. I'm well aware that calling out women for being bad mothers is considered Blasphemous and sacrilegious in our society, but poor mothering is a real thing that affects millions of lives both men and women with toxic motherhood children are the victims with talk with toxic motherhood children.  Our mishandled with toxic motherhood children are neglected. So the signs of toxic motherhood are often physical abuse severe emotional and physical neglect lack of affection and affirmation which are the building blocks of high self-esteem and worth and with toxic motherhood often comes a lot of normalize dysfunction as well as possible high levels of narcissism and mental abuse now when we are children,
8:  Yeah, that's in terms of conversation with okay?  Yeah, so yeah, we're just going to do a couple of episodes we're going to put a load of episodes different topics challenging normals also advice tips tricks. They've experienced that's also got a lot of experience and often on a weight-loss Journey myself. What else we're going to cover. Okay, we're going to try and cover relevant topics that come up maybe in the news and media and
9:  Friends do not have the tools to mentally process the experience of abuse for the most part children do what they are told to survive because children are well aware of how dependent they are on the adults who are around them. And that is why children are sponges. They absorb whatever the emotional environment supplies, you know, whether good or bad children see their caregivers or their parents or their mothers as therefore as their first point of contact with God.  My parents to children are literally God, but the problem and the problems that often arise in toxic motherhood. Is that children tend to absorb a lot of negativity and false beliefs about themselves and absorption absorption leads to parental damage. And that is why toxicity is passed down from one generation to the next and to the next until it becomes a generational curse with toxic motherhood many mothers and many women for the most

4:  It had like one of the easiest schedule set and the year. I really don't see many games. The Giants can win. I'm being honest with you. It's going to be a struggle or seizure dressed in november/december. It's another month of November. December were Giants football means nothing and yes, it's a rebuilding fit face. But like even though we're on a podcast right now. We're first fans and we want to see your team succeed and it's gonna be a struggle for these next few months just to watch this team. It's painful, but we're going to be here.  Here after every game and just going to talk about probably more John's losses. I mean, hey, we still got one more Monday Night Football game to talk about a giant sloth. That's going to be a good one.
5:  I know I said on Friday show that I really believe the Jaws can win this game. And I meant that because chalice is coming off a bye and I felt like Daniel Jones had a good game against Detroit that there is reason for optimism and that optimism was there in the 1st quarter 2nd quarter, but then it just all fell off and I just saw this now I have an engram said whether he said the Jets at the can lose game every game is a can lose game. It's the John.  It had like one of the easiest schedule set and the year. I really don't see many games. The Giants can win. I'm being honest with you. It's going to be a struggle or seizure dressed in november/december. It's another month of November. December were Giants football means nothing and yes, it's a rebuilding fit face. But like even though we're on a podcast right now. We're first fans and we want to see your team succeed and it's gonna be a struggle for these next few months just to watch this team. It's painful, but we're going to be here.
6:  Governor I mean the defense played so well is hard hard not to get excited about that. Really, isn't it? Yeah, I think sort of the big thing for me in this game is obviously the defense played amazingly and we'll talk a little bit more detail about some of the performances from particular players, but we knew that going in we knew that the defense is one of most talented in the NFL. We've been talking about that for weeks. Even if you know the cognoscenti is that hands us calls. It doesn't realize that yet but the offense the way that they were able to maintain  Possession and and you know make it on third down and the problems have been talking about leading up to this game not fixed at all. But definitely an improvement and how much of that is down to the game management of duck. And how much of it is is just game plan in general. I don't know. I'm sure we can talk about that in a bit more detail how much you know about duck.
7:  Quality game that till this day people still swear by and it has like, you know multiplayer to Street Fighter 5. Yep. We talked about that. What else we get inside? Oh, yeah the follow-up to limbo limbo. Yeah, what else we got a game.  Propolis and I really like that man Titanfall 2. Whoa, which is right now on PS4 plus if you get it's a free game this month for December. So try to get that and use that as your Christmas cake while you're sitting with family. You can just run wall ride and shit. Yeah. Seriously Earth Defense Force for that was when I jumped into it nice me and the homeys until dawn we was until dawn. Oh no.
8:  The outcome of this game and how would I react and just try to think of different worlds of that game? Because if you do that, you don't then need to play a whole bunch of games to be in that situation again, like you can have one game function at the same level of probably like five or six games if you're willing to run through five or six simulations in your head based on different inflection points of the game and that takes practice right? I'm not going to sit here and pretend that this is like an easy thing to learn but the easiest way that I would say is just after you play any game  Just think okay what card was really useful in my game that if I don't have it forces me to change my play and then on my opponents side at what point in the game could they have had like a too much to protect or could they have had a board wipe or could they have had like a really oppressive creature like saying Amber amp or a Shadow Self? When could they have had a card that really could have swung things in their Direction? Because if you do that, it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of any
9:  Get in there and this guy named Marcus Graham. He also goes by the name DJ. We reached out to me and said hey I can get you in and so I connected with him he ends up being and I didn't know at the time he ends up being like the John Madden of Esports. He he was a Caster before there was casting and then he went on to work at twitch. So he kind of got me hooked into twitch. And at this point, it's like 2011. I had no idea that people played video games on the internet and people would watch them, you know on YouTube and you know kind of  Barely getting started. Anyway. Yeah, it was crazy. And like I'm I love video games my entire life. I just didn't know there was kind of this this combination of entertainment and video games and I saw it and he's like, hey, you should really do this and you should try it on Twitch. And and so I did it. I think my first dream was like December 2011 maybe and it just kind of grew from there and just and just being in that space. One of the hardest things for me to do was pivot from hey, you're Dan from Big Brother.
 
Topic 33 hvac industry environmentalism: What is the HVAC industry doing to promote sustainability and “green” technology?  Has it been effective?  What is the effect on people working in the industry?
0:  Before they leave us so that they're not, you know fumbling through, you know, the very basic functions of how to be HVAC technician, you know, so, you know, I think that the new technology that's out there all these digital types of gauges and some of the newer bluetooth-enabled think like that. I think it's fantastic for technician that knows how to use a basic set of gauges. Yeah, go ahead and at one point at some point in your career, you know,  Stan those digital gauges because the digital gauges themselves don't make you the super technician, you know, if you don't know how to take your Ricans on a standard manifold set of gauges and understand what those readings mean to you. It doesn't matter how much you spend on a set of gauges. It's still not going to get you anywhere exactly. That's really what my ideas were, you know, you know some of the some of the I've seen electricians nevermind HVAC technicians and not the knocking electrician or an HVAC technician eyes.
1:  I'm out. It's been a blast. Happy HVAC.
2:  You want but it's the field experience when shit hits the fan. That's when you really start to learn when when you're by yourself and there's nobody there to help you and you struggle and you you bleed and sometimes you cry because I'm sure there's a lot of HVAC texts have been stuck on jobs that have shed tears. That's when you start to learn and in my opinion.  It's out of frustration. It really is. Yeah, because you got to do something to get that system running or whatever it is. Yeah, I have to agree on that dinner. So so the episode the topic of the episode is you wanted to discuss some of the older tools and and just how text should should come into the industry. Just kind of knowing how to use these tools of whether the older or newer or whatever. So maybe you can get into what your thoughts were on that.
3:  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but  So the deal is he came in so my new operation super excited about it. He always look I get a lot of Consulting from a lot of people. Some of them are friends of them charge me. Some of them just come from books some of them podcast, but he came in flew into town wanted to hang out show them my place showed him. My plan showed him. My pll's my balance sheet and he said hey you're losing. It wasn't $150,000 in these four markets. He goes. Can I just take a guess on what's going on?
4:  Things in a day because they're so busy putting out fires. They don't understand the tax laws her amazing right now and how to really I'm not saying don't pay your taxes, but there are certain things you could do to pay less taxes, you know, this is fun for me. But yeah there I just went on and on about you ask me a simple question. It's me. Yeah. There's you were in the Atlanta Market here. I saw one of your trucks. Are you guys still here you guys move out?  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but
5:  Graham recently and you're doing some some pretty cool stuff by kind of showing some of the history of the trades and I saw your post about the older tools and the older trucks and I think that's really awesome. It's so if you want to just like shout out your Instagram profile name and kind of what you're doing and how you came up with the idea to do that kind of stuff. That would be cool.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, you know and on Instagram, it's HVAC chronicler. So basically can check me out there. You know, I came up with the idea. I did start it. Actually December the first week of December this last in a little last past year and had some great response so far in a lot of support by some of the bigger guys that are out there including yourself HVAC or refer guy a few others.
6:  Getting yourself to a position where you're becoming the most effective version of you. Like I said, this is what this podcast is all about and over the next coming days weeks. Hopefully even years of success of with this podcast. I'm going to be sharing those tips tricks and hacks. I'm also going to be bringing people on to the podcast that are being effective at the highest level, whether that's some of the most effective Fitness coaches in the industry, whether that's effective business people whether that's some of my own clients or people. I know that have a crazy amazing incredible transformations.  I'm going to be bringing them to this podcast. So you can hear stories from other people that if you don't buy it from me, if you don't get it from me that you can be motivated and make a change. Maybe the you're going to get that from someone else. So on the next few episodes, I'm going to be interviewing. Like I said some of the best in the industry and the fitness industry getting them to share with us what's allowed them to become a fitness executive themself? Because it was only yesterday. I was listening to someone else's podcast where a multi-millionaire I'm talking. This guy's net worth was a hundred and
7:  I will get back to you. We'll do a little research because it only makes you a better technician if you can you should always be under the mindset of I want to always work, you know, there's sorry to say there's not a technician out there that knows how to do everything. If they do tell you that they're either delusional or they're lying to themselves and you you know, so there's way too much this, you know, the HVAC field encompasses so much that there's so many specialty little things here and there that nobody can know everything so I'm not so much embarrassed when a  don't ask me something. I don't know. I'd be more embarrassed if I didn't go and find that information for them and make sure they understood that you know, what I would almost exactly I totally agree with you and just a little secret that the whole name of my podcasts and brand HVAC know-it-all is based on guys that walk around and thinking they know everything because it's completely funny. It's very hilarious wouldn't what when you have text that walk around and they think they know everything you ask them a question and they kind of fire back.
8:  Oh, yeah, absolutely. So, you know and on Instagram, it's HVAC chronicler. So basically can check me out there. You know, I came up with the idea. I did start it. Actually December the first week of December this last in a little last past year and had some great response so far in a lot of support by some of the bigger guys that are out there including yourself HVAC or refer guy a few others.  You know, I basically had the idea. You know, I'm here at school teaching, you know, love doing the teaching thing. But you know, I just wanted to kind of put out some of the things that not necessarily lesson plans and things that I'm teaching, you know every day, but kind of get the idea out there what some of the things I'm covering with the students that maybe some of the technicians that have been out for a while. Maybe, you know, never really got a true grasp of whether in school or maybe just be a quick reminder for them some of the things that maybe they can brush up on, you know, I do

The ten Rings kidnaps Stark Industries CEO, Tony Stark and forces him to build weapons for them ostensibly to even the odds.  Instead Stark secretly builds a suit of weaponized armor that he then uses to escape but during his captivity.

Topic 36 cryptocurrency risks: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies?  Many people are talking about cryptocurrency as an investment and it seems to have many benefits.  Are there any drawbacks?  What are they?  What setbacks have people suffered when investing in cryptocurrencies?
0:  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait  Wait lists go through some complex. Use I that's tailored to a traitor not till like an ordinary consumer. And the worst part about it is you can't just buy cryptocurrency with a credit card or US Dollars. You have to actually bring cryptocurrency from somewhere else used it to get cryptocurrency. Well, this is way too much to ask for an ordinary person to get through.
1:  Hey guys, it's great to be here.  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait
2:  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.  That gives you the credentials to sell cryptocurrency and a wallet is really just that grip that the private key. Okay, but I buy that you send it to me at five cryptocurrencies is the five top market caps. So like unicorny 3000 top 100. Yeah, that's okay. So you get top 100. I bought five you send me it and there's 50 bucks on there. We have packages of different packages. Okay. Now I got the key. Yes. Okay. Now what do I do with it? Great. So we have clients who?
3:  So there it is the fundamentals of crypto. We've learned what it is what problems in might solve and how people around the world are using it. Now remember it's still quite volatile, but nevertheless what if you're interested in buying it for yourself or looking at it as an investment, you'll have, you know, six months in a row of Bitcoin up every month and it feels like a risk free trade. It's easy right just happens every month you make money and then people start getting greedy. That's alright Paul managing partner blocked our capital a hedge fund focused on investing.  In cryptocurrencies will be talking to him in the next episode and will be learning the investment side of crypto.
4:  People doing bad things. It's all of the other people too. But you're kind of seeing all the same people that made mobile work. You're saying all the same people that made social networking work. You're seeing all the same people that made the internet work or early PCS work. So yes, there are some people here that are doing some bad things but there are a lot of other people here too. Now that we have a good understanding of Bitcoin. What about some of the other cryptocurrencies out there? And actually what's the difference between a cryptocurrency and a crypto asset crypto assets is sort of the more  odd term because there are certain types of crypto assets which are not necessarily currencies because one of the properties that you need of a currency is that it's fungible right like a dollar is a dollar and so Bitcoin is effectively a Bitcoin and they're interchangeable. Whereas for something like a Pokemon go card, you might have two different types of Pokémon cards. And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between
5:  We acquire five cryptocurrencies for you out of the top 100 by market cap. We secure them using military-grade encryption on this device. This is a c block.  And it is the starter kit To Join the cryptocurrency Revolution. So we launched a pilot and in 30 days. We generated sales of more than thirty thousand dollars. We had International interests shipping to customers in eight countries on five continents. And so we're doing a seed round to launch our product in Canada.
6:  And it is the starter kit To Join the cryptocurrency Revolution. So we launched a pilot and in 30 days. We generated sales of more than thirty thousand dollars. We had International interests shipping to customers in eight countries on five continents. And so we're doing a seed round to launch our product in Canada.  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.
7:  Survive in such a bad economy. And one of the ways I survived is with cryptocurrencies with such bad inflation. It'd be crazy to keep his wealth entirely in believe ours. So in that case you're using your bolivars to purchase Bitcoin and then holding Bitcoin instead of the Bolivar. A lot of people are doing that. But because of my work I don't actually earn in local currency. I write and I get paid in Bitcoin or in cryptocurrency simply.  Because of thanks to our currency controls. I cannot have bank accounts in in dollars is simply not legally Can Only Hold local currency. So cryptocurrencies are away from me to bypass all of these restrictions and actually get paid for my work and can you give us can you share? What is your daily routine look like when you're you know shopping for food or paying expenses or paying rent. How does that work for you? So in that a lot of people accept Bitcoin directly, so
8:  odd term because there are certain types of crypto assets which are not necessarily currencies because one of the properties that you need of a currency is that it's fungible right like a dollar is a dollar and so Bitcoin is effectively a Bitcoin and they're interchangeable. Whereas for something like a Pokemon go card, you might have two different types of Pokémon cards. And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between  Didn't Bitcoin like how did those even come to be? Yeah, so there are three categories of cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin that we think about there are things that are actually more decentralized even that Bitcoin and a lot of these are where people who have deep academic background in distributed systems and cryptography have come into the space in the last several years and created you can almost think of them as new and better Bitcoin. And so for example, there are some projects like space mesh.
9:  You're very bright. I mean clearly you're super super bright. So I'm not I'm not negating that I'm just saying that this seems a little bit scammy a little bit scammy. And how do you what's a process you go through to validate these companies true and how are you picking these for me one and how are you not gaming the system by companies you mean these cryptocurrencies? Yeah. Yeah, I mean because it can be you're elevating right the appetite for them. You are the appetite for the mind.  To spend it or is it a investment view you can we do this? So we view this as a product not an investment and it's an opportunity to get started and to learn how like how it works more than trying to trade. So most of the cryptocurrency businesses out there. They're either issuing their own tokens or coins or their facility facilitating the exchange of them to make money to pump and dump with our product we ship you.
 
Topic 37 slow travel: What is “slow travel”?  I heard about this approach to traveling the world recently when reading about sustainable living, and I’d like to hear more about it.  What does it have to do with sustainability?
0:  You to slow down and free yourself from the stress and dissatisfaction of your daily life. The way most Millennials are living right now is absolutely not sustainable for their health and not sustainable for their happiness. I truly believe if we want to be a sustainable Society then we need to make sure each soul is successful and what I mean by successful is I mean happy and living in alignment with their soul mission.  I truly believe if we wish to shift the standard of life, we must as individuals take self-responsibility to do the work on ourselves. If we want to live a life. We love we need to show up and do the work and change our vibration because our vibration is the world's vibration to me. This is what holistic health looks like on a global scale sustainable Souls create a sustainable society, which
1:  Hi everyone. Thank you so much for tuning in today. I'm renal in the founder of the slow life solution and you are listening to the trailer for The get in the slow podcast. I wanted to quickly pop on here today to share with you the main message behind this lowlife solution and what I'll be talking about moving forward on this journey together through this beautiful platform My Hope Is that the slow life solution will spark a light in this media filled Millennial worlds and inspire  You to slow down and free yourself from the stress and dissatisfaction of your daily life. The way most Millennials are living right now is absolutely not sustainable for their health and not sustainable for their happiness. I truly believe if we want to be a sustainable Society then we need to make sure each soul is successful and what I mean by successful is I mean happy and living in alignment with their soul mission.
2:  You know way of living right but for those of you know you that are out there that might have you know children or you might have like a very demanding career job, or maybe you have like family members who are sick and require some of your attention that takes up a lot of your time, but you really Aspire for more you're not satisfied or complacent with where you live or what you drive or you know your relationship or where you travel your lifestyle or whatever the case may be.  You know, I think there are some ways that you can kind of it's all about perspective for me at the end of the day. And again, I'm not this isn't like the only solution because I'm just one perspective but it all kind of starts with perspective. Right? And so for me and you've heard, you know, if you've done any personal development or all you've heard Tony Robbins say this before which is like you have to turn your shoulds into musts. It's a really really powerful distinguishing kind of approach to this dilemma.
3:  He traveled with friends. I think once or twice at least internationally. So one thing I notice is that and with sorry with that being said, I've traveled like a few times with my family. So when I know when I travel with my friends, I notice everything that I've picked up from traveling with my family is translated when I travel with my friends the the point where it's like, well I'm a parent like when you travel because it's probably the most efficiently  I believe yeah, you know Seiko it works for them will work for me. But then they're just those types are like, oh my God my dad. Does this they could carry your passport that finding everything ya ready reading everything like in line while in Immigration before you get to the counter? Yeah. Everyone should do that. Don't be the guy who's like writing it and he won't let you go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah little and I guess you're more responsible when you're with friends as compared to when you hear a bit more.
4:  Two and a half three weeks and then I moved back to Milwaukee and start my new internship, but my new internship I travel every other week and I don't know where I get to travel to yet. It says anywhere in the United States or Canada. So that means I could be on a plane in a new city every other week. So I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling in 2020 which I'm really excited for but also a little nervous, but I think it'll be good having that European travel.  Laying like under my belt before I have to do the carry-on situation every other week because I kind of hate living on the suitcase, but I've recently accepted that that's going to be my way of life for the next nine months. So it'll be fine, but I'm excited for that. And then the last thing is learning a new language. I only know English. I took Spanish in high school, but that was just like not that's just
5:  or like, you know scabs on its around its legs from chains. You're not supporting a sustainable industry and it's so sad, it's horrible. But like I didn't realize that the travel industry was moving that progressively forward in that way in Africa in places like it is in some places. I mean, it's it's all subjective but I suppose if subjective see the yes, correct. Yes. Yeah.  Wine, but no it's interesting because I mean some parts of the world. It's not but some some places. I mean there are regulations that are being put in place. I mean if you look at just like the Sloth Sanctuary in Costa Rica, which became huge with celebrities and Instagram traffic and everyone wanted to go and swim with a slob and they do their best from what I hear.
6:  Lutely not but it's still something. It's still a clue to like, okay. Wow. This really didn't work for railing right like you still take something away from that. But anyways, what are you currently reading? So I'm currently reading a book that I'm quite excited for and that is the hike by Drew magary. I don't know if that's how you say his name. Okay. I'm actually kind of angry that you're reading that I'm please explain. Okay, so I have never heard of anyone reading the hike yeah until very  Recently someone who wrote in to our podcast was like I want a book and I something like the hike or something and I was like no I found the hike in a bookstore like two or three years ago bought it because it sounded so weird and I was determined that I was going to be like, I don't know like one of the first people like a hipster like a book hipster. Look I'm gonna discover. I'm going to discover a book that I can then share with people and like
7:  I want to travel the world. Maybe you're not going to do that as want you're not going to do that all at once you're going to take that first trip. I have this crazy idea that I might want to do some like van life stuff like living out of a van and like traveling around the country. I've thought about that for years and years. I might not start with that super tech doubt van that like it's a crazy build that has air conditioning inside and to shower whatever like I might just have to buy a crappy pickup truck and see what living in that is like, but again, it's these little baby steps.  Oops, which is it's a beautiful thing, but everyone has literally everybody that's listening to this has some like really crazy out their dream and it's like what is this? What is 1% of that? And and can you do that one percent right. I have this dream. I really want to interview Gary vaynerchuk on the podcast. I'm continuing to put this out in the world. If anyone's listening to this and knows Gary right? I'm not going to do that right now all this is building it up. All these experiences are accumulating so that when I actually do interview him one day
8:  Of reading so I've never I never studied writing. I did the science degree at University which is a bit stupid. So I've never actually done any kind of nice creative writing since I was about 15, so writing and form, he's always been very much linked with reading which is something that I've always enjoyed and loved and learn from so it was reading books that got me wanting to travel and wanting to explore and push myself and go on adventures and then from endlessly reading books.  Suppose that gradually sowed the seed in my mind of that. I'd like to try and tell a story as well and I always had this Daydream and actually it's still my Daydream even after 13 books. I always had this day dream of wouldn't it be cool to earn your living by being a travel writer and I suppose I'm hoping that one there might be able to earn my living just from writing which would be a great. Well, I think like many things I dreamed that it would be a nice thing to do in reality. Of course. It's a lot of work. But yeah, all of
9:  I hear all the time. People are like, oh my gosh, you're going somewhere every month. Like how do you do that? And then it's literally just because I make it a priority. I'm like traveling is a priority to me. I always say travel is my first love and some like if you guys just sat down it's like did the planning it's not hard. Yeah. Yeah, I agree and like you said it's a matter of priorities people spending money on so many other things like I rarely buy new clothes, obviously that has other reasons.  Ins because I want to only sustain support sustainable fashion, but that saves me so much money, whereas before I was spending. I don't know a couple hundred bucks every month on clothes that were on sale that made me believe that I was saving money, but really I was spending money and when you stop yeah, maybe just observe your habits where you spend your money all the time and then just change the way you spend your money and your priorities.
 
Topic 38 workplace diversity: What are things companies are doing and could do to promote diversity in the workplace?  Things like workplace programs, initiatives, education, and outreach are relevant.  Discussion about the outcomes of these efforts are relevant as well.
0:  City it's kind of like saying we will only accept lesbians, you know into our business like we will only focus on helping dyslexics will let me help focus on lesbians. I'm not saying anyone's ever done that but it's kind of the same concept. It's like you're picking one stream as opposed to understanding how the neuro-diverse brain works how the what we call the right side has or the right brain works and looking at how you helped that group because  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how
1:  have talked about some of the experiences that they've had in their workplace and see if you can identify them in your own workplace and see if there are ways that you can start to help your workplace address them and for people who maybe do not identify as heterosexual also sort of do a self-assessment and think about some of the different topics we discussed see if you feel like those are common themes maybe in your workplace or in your experience and kind of see maybe  See how being queer or identifying as something that's not heterosexual affects your mental health if at all, it might not and you might be totally out and proud and maybe only positively affects your mental health, but if it doesn't sort of like start to self assassin check in with yourself and pay attention to the ways that your workplace or people you're interacting with maybe heightened some negative mental health symptoms for you and start thinking about ways that you can sort of make your brain feel better.
2:  A mere show come from yeah. It was like all a dream. I think you look came up with the name and she thinks I came up with the name. Jeanne came up with a name. So what it is, we're brainstorming names and we're trying to come up with things that aren't sexist. The one that was the most like tongue-in-cheek that I thought was funny was Battlestar hysterical initially Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace was like the tag under the title. So it would be you know Battlestar hysterical Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace and  We kept saying this over and over and I was like, oh, it's just the tag and I was like, it just needs a sing-song under it's like Battle Tactics for your 6 is workplace and then no and so I recorded that and I sent that to Jeannie because I woke up the next morning and I was like, why did you listen me a voice memo it like one o'clock in the morning and it was you singing Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace. And I was like, that's all we need. We just need people to be able to Google it. You know, I think it's something really valuable in the name that it's just google-able.
3:  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how  Supported as a whole but we're not quite there. So what can you do in the meantime? So one of the one of the things that popped up in the group was around meetings and around if you're stuck in a meeting for an hour and a half and if you're in any business that has more than 10 15 20 employees meetings still seem to be at the Forefront of what companies think they're about, you know, you get stuck in those board tables and and usually someone who's got a left brain talks really slowly with it.
4:  Person in this room. I am going to handle the street homework for the week. I think the straight homework for this week. Your homework is to I think start like assessing your environment. We talk a lot about self assessment with respect to mental health and I think as a straight person this is not your area of internal. Well, I mean, I mean you do need to reflect internally as well, but I think for purposes of this podcast think about some of the things that Lauren  have talked about some of the experiences that they've had in their workplace and see if you can identify them in your own workplace and see if there are ways that you can start to help your workplace address them and for people who maybe do not identify as heterosexual also sort of do a self-assessment and think about some of the different topics we discussed see if you feel like those are common themes maybe in your workplace or in your experience and kind of see maybe
5:  Another Community member or like somebody who I could relate to in that way the idea of it and the idea is like a diverse A diversity of people being in the workplace that I think would have been helpful and it for sure didn't help any like mental health symptoms I had how was your experience? Yeah. I think your point about isolation feeling isolated. I think that is something that I really identify with because when you don't have other people who  See you or our show right away that they're willing to accept who you are. Then you do either self isolate or you have to it becomes a chore to then push yourself to show them to come out to them as we were talking about and because of that you don't really know who you can talk to you about personal struggles that you might have in your relationship struggles your because often has to be said it making friends when your adult is hard and often the easiest friends to make other ones you work with but if those people
6:  Finally difficult boss number three mrs. X defined by mrs. X because there's not one key negative term that would showcase why she should not be managing people in the workplace. There was many often you would see mrs. X roam the workplace hallways with a sour look in.  Face looking like she was disgusted to be there or disgusted with the people that were working for her mrs. X was different than the previous two difficult bosses because she had no human Spirit people would come and see mrs. X with a problem and often be responded with well, that's not my issue. You solve it. You should have came and see me a long time ago or let me pick up the phone and call a lawyer instead of using your education background.
7:  Your metaphor. No. No, you're not. It's I always say representation still matters, right? So they're still as a piece of diversity where you know, I don't believe in Quota systems, but I also believe you just have to you have to see it to believe it. So if you're going to say you're a diverse and inclusive community or Workforce, but there's no one who's a woman or identified as a woman that I can see that's representing then I'm not sure I would believe someone you know, so I think that those two things still play very close together.  Now, I mean you obviously talked with a lot of individuals and organizations and you're involved with different community outreach programs and conferences. What do you feel are the most pressing topics of discussion in the diversity inclusion world right now, I think for me some of the more pressing conversations to be honest our conversations that we've been having for quite some time, but I do think
8:  We kept saying this over and over and I was like, oh, it's just the tag and I was like, it just needs a sing-song under it's like Battle Tactics for your 6 is workplace and then no and so I recorded that and I sent that to Jeannie because I woke up the next morning and I was like, why did you listen me a voice memo it like one o'clock in the morning and it was you singing Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace. And I was like, that's all we need. We just need people to be able to Google it. You know, I think it's something really valuable in the name that it's just google-able.  Make sense. I think it's important for some a woman to be able to sit down at her computer at work and say oh my gosh. This is the most sexist workplace. Hey, listen, my organization called girls who code right? Same thing. You will learn how to code. Okay, then go on and you find us so it's very easy. So your show focuses on like tactics. What were some of your favorite Battle Tactics? Hmm for me, I would say all of them are like get a posse get organized, you know build with people so many of our tactics are impossible to really
9:  And even see them. Yeah, so where was the car so so so she likes someone remember he know she it's a she right? It's a I would think it's a no because he liked the younger because if we're not we're not supposed to know, you know, but like it's the girl he's talking he or she's talking about had a boyfriend. So I'm I'm gonna assume it's a boy, okay.  Okay. Yeah. Oh, they're still I mean it could be a little okay. Anyways, um, okay, so so I don't know about your workplace my workplace.
 
Topic 39 social media marketing: I’m looking for tips and suggestions for creating a social media marketing strategy.  What kinds of things do I need to think about?  How can I reach the most people online?  Are there companies that can help?
0:  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise.

My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and
1:  Before you take somebody on to help you with your social media. It's just one example, but get that it's I always think it's like you wouldn't get in a car without having a map or knowing where you're going.

Like I think marketing is probably the biggest area that people struggle with that and mindset but they don't realize the mindset is actually impacting them the way it is, but with marketing I  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there.

I was just speaking to a client the other day and she had been working with a social media manager and she said I'm just not getting the results and it's because  Before you take somebody on to help you with your social media. It's just one example, but get that it's I always think it's like you wouldn't get in a car without having a map or knowing where you're going.

3:  College I do online school because that works best for my schedule. Maybe you that's really irrelevant, but just thought I you know put it out there this podcast is for entrepreneurs this podcast is for aspiring entrepreneurs business owners young talented people that are looking for advice looking for inspiration and motivation to achieve more reach for more.  And get to your end goals. So the kind of content you'll be seeing from us is insights on sales marketing entrepreneurship. You'll be seeing interviews with successful entrepreneurs in the area, you know, so I have so much plan and I'm so excited. It will be talking a lot about branding and social media and e-commerce and my social media marketing agency if that's something you guys want.
4:  Do yeah sure. So and as an agency, we're helping startups and established companies sell more of their products and services for greater profit. For more money. Pretty much we do this by building a powerful Business website for them. That's gonna help them thrive in a competitive Marketplace. Then we help them Reach their ideal audience. It could be either on Facebook or on Google other social media or other platforms. And then once we have those visitors be then convert them into leads or customers.  For them. Wow. It's a whole thing in one room together. It's a marketing system that actually is composed of a couple of services. So like I said, there's a it's going to be a website some business marketing strategy online advertising design and photography and some content as well. It's a whole package sort of is but we're trying to like keep the focus on delivering or we say like help themselves. It's really a whole package and
5:  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and  Jion money into the specific elements. That would be a kind of top tip for me as get right first thing. That's so important as I think that's the thing. It's like everybody like a headless chicken. Yeah, and I think that's a big is that we try to do all the things and then when you try and do everything it just is a total mess and disaster and you wonder why you're not getting anywhere near side. Yeah. They also monitor obviously. So once you have decided once you've got your strategy in place and you've committed
6:  my kids are 9 and 15. So they're at quite kind of crucial ages for school and things we did look into the schooling over there, but we didn't it doesn't compare really to here. So so for now it's just all about growing my audience and giving as much value as I possibly can and teaching people about marketing because I'm really passionate about the difference that marketing can make to your business. I just think there are so many problems and questions in business that can.  Answered through doing more strategic marketing and the more the more people I speak to as well but social media for example, and I just think if you get your strategy, right you save yourself so much time and money. I was just speaking to a client the other day and she had been working with a social media manager and she said I'm just not getting the results and it's because
7:  Engagement and traffic but I think that engagement or just a good overall indicator of quality of that. Yeah, cool. Yeah. The last data point I wanted to share is that the vast majority of marketers 85% use third-party tools like buffer to support the social media marketing tools can help you to streamline your workflows help you to save time and even ensure your content reaches the Right audience as the right at the right time absolutely tools are arguably more important than ever with the amount of outgoing and incoming volume brands are  These days so lots of brands are using social media as a customer service tool as well as for amplification and just a little bit more about the 1800 marketers that took our survey 49 percent of the people who took our survey work at companies with fewer than 10 full-time staff a further 20.5% work at companies with between 11 to 50 full-time members and about twenty three percent of marketers work at companies with over a hundred employees. And in terms of marketing team size the majority of respondents in our survey.
8:  So all these companies are also going online because that's where our customers are. And this is the only reason why didn't the market is growing like anything and it is one of the best career option while because it's a very new thing and use this almost every company they need to go digital if they want to grow. So then we're in a market like if you know digital marketing there are companies who will ask you for help and you can help them. Maybe you can join them all so you can  And then see in all of question is how to get started. Like if you are someone who is totally new digital marketing you might be thinking how to get started. So I will be telling you how to get started like how I started and how you can learn the art of real marketing. So what I advise is that these this if I talk about digital marketing it's a big topic like you have social media content writing content management content distribution SEO and lot of things well,
9:  Business and entrepreneurial content but that's coming soon. I am an owner of a digital advertising company called Pro Way advertising where we do social media marketing for local businesses in the Florida area.

Topic 40 bees dying: There have been numerous news reports of bees and other pollinators dying. I want to learn what I can do personally to help bees and other pollinators. General discussions about habitat loss are not relevant.
0: Hey everyone, welcome back to be on the talk of podcast formed in conjunction with Ted xuf and independently organized Ted event determined to dive deeper into the talks that you know, and love I'm Erica and I Virginia back in Action second episode of the podcast is season. We are very very excited because today is our very first interview. We put it into perspective. We're going to talk about the be in business recent years. You probably have heard a lot about saving the bees and the dying bee population is seen a lot of increased press according to the be informed. Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.

It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.  Beats, so obviously we should care about them a little bit, right? Yeah, no definitely super important and you have actually plays a very big role in this because they are the world's leading entomology Department according to the Center for World university rankings. And in tandem with funding from the state just spilled a four million dollar honey. Bee lab dedicated to the next generation of be research. So after gonna be he's no that's that's the that's the be in business. So here today. We have our first interview Robert Schulte. Robert is a third year here at University of Florida.
2:  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.
3:  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.  So that is teaching so many other people about the life cycle of honey bees.
4:  Queen bee and worker bees and a few drones at the very at it was very interesting. Finally at the for station. We played a true or false begin test our knowledge about the life cycle of honey bees here are some things each of us learned. I learned that all worker bees are females. There are hundreds of kinds of the  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.
5:  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.  So I think that's great. You know, you've got very Target audiences, right? You've got Growers. You've got beekeepers Etc. So, how do you how do you fund your extension program? Right. That's one of the discussions in our world is we what we got all these great ideas to reach beekeepers Etc. But that costs money. So how do you generate funding to support your extension program at Michigan State? Yes million dollar question for all of us, right? We've been very fortunate. It is a time that people do really care about bees.
6:  What is it that you and your lab do at Michigan State University in the realm of extension? What is it to you? And what do you do? And what are you trying to achieve? Sure. So the main overarching mission is to respond to practical needs in the agricultural Community my rules a little different than some of the straight beekeeping extension and apiculture is positioned. So when I started I've been at Michigan State for 5 years now in my current position  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are
7:  About this because nobody wants nobody wants to be reminded that something's at least in part their fault, you know, it is not true that the planet is dying. It is true that you are murdering the planet, right and the media would much rather tell you that the planet is dying number one, which does we've you feeling paralyzed. Yeah and guilty. Right, but nobody said you're guilty and then people can argue about whether individual a  Your matters or whether you have to have whole countries and you have to have whole countries. Well, then as China and India is not the u.s. Even though we polluted 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and the last hundred years or so anyway on and on and on you can do all that and it becomes more distant and you do become paralyzed and you do become depressed and people change the channel. Yeah. Yeah, so nobody wants to report the climate news, which is yes.
8:  Recognize the importance and so I would say that we do focus on programs that we can fund. Plus we do have some general funding. So my position itself is funded directly through Michigan State University my I'm funded half through egg by a research and half the MSU Extension. And so that does give me flexibility to kind of operate on things that I find important either way for our extension. We've received funding from both the Michigan commercial.  Purrs and the Michigan Beekeepers Association, we received a grant through MSU Extension to develop like our pollinator Champions Course, but now that has become self funded in that it does bring in money. So that's one of the things that we're trying to do a little more is findings programs that can at minimum be self-supporting so that they can fund the instructors and fund the space and from the bees or whatever we need. We did get a really large.

We did get a really large.  It's to do called might check which is a critical agriculture research and extension Grant which was really extension focused to try to train people on mites and so on and how to monitor for them. And so that so a lot of the Outreach that we do is extension funded. We also have a large program Heroes to hives and that's been largely donation funded a so it is trying to put we even crowd-sourced to get our
 
Topic 41 gmo food labeling: Some people say we should avoid foods with genetically-modified organisms as ingredients. I would like to learn about GMO food labeling. What are people saying about the pros and cons? What’s the difference between the European and US approaches to GMO food labeling?
0: Welcome to the dr. Berg healthy Ketone intermittent fasting podcast. Now your host the man taking your health to a whole new level. Dr. Eric Berg.  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of
1:  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of  Site, but even worse than that the glycemic index is a hundred and ten like table sugar is 70. This is a hundred and ten. I don't know of anything that's actually more than that. So you're consuming this sugar that will spike your blood sugar's so much compared to any other foods. Not only that the FDA does not include multiple dextran in the definition of added sugars.
2:  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.  Hey, if you're liking this content, Please Subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos.
3:  of them are thin but I will say there's a big difference between the European countries and America. Okay, especially France and even Italy now the French consume a lot more fat the four times as much butter 60% more cheese a hundred eighty grams of fat from animal sources versus the US it's only 72. So in France, they're eating more saturated fats in America. We consume way more vegetable oil.  Like corn oil and soil which are GMO which can lead to insulin resistance. Okay, that alone can actually make you gain weight. They have three times as much pork. They have less high fructose corn syrup. I'll get to this in a second. They tend to keep their traditional foods. Okay, like in America, every single corner has a Thai restaurant in Italian restaurant a Mexican restaurant. You don't see that
4:  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.  There's no denying GMO when it's around it. Yeah, you know what it is.
5:  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.  I just kind of dismissed it because I knew it was a longer flour. So it didn't really work and my setup that I had and I finally took the leap to do it because we were trying to get into the solvent list and we know it's a tried and true as far as washing the flower but you know, I like it now. I'd like to get it back in the garden after growing it finally. How long did you end up running your GMO?
6:  Hold on people one second.  All right. So yeah organic is not special organic is, you know, just regular Foods actually, you know, if you do your research, you know organic food should be able to be made cheaper than actual GMO foods, but you know, they trick us with the industry and make us think that these things are not so so, you know, my point of researching all of this thing is that people don't know the depth of the problem. So therefore they don't know the death of the solution and a lot of us we
7:  Who their grandchildren the grand grand children? Our children's names are yummy so they not even great examples to they actually had more nutrient available food growing up because they had less GMO sourced food. So growing up in the 1930s and 40s black people ate much healthier before the fast food chains came in they had a whole childhood right growing off of nutrient available Foods. They ate more fruits and vegetables growing up. It wasn't until right later on 16.  Seventies eighties nineties or whatever is that they actually started eating less healthier you don't talking about so that their system their immune system was built up at least of more organic foods, but we think organic inspection.
8:  Yeah, you know definitely it's going to affect it. I think just um you as a gardener is going to affect it what you spray what you feed it your environment. There's definitely a lot of variables when it comes to it. But you know as far as what I do I stick to a schedule I try to find genetics at work and that schedule so the GMO was a bit of an adjustment. Even our grape stomp or you know  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.
9:  Yeah, I mean there's definitely a lot of hype behind some strange nowadays but a lot of them stand up to it, you know anything with great flavor draws me and right away. I'm a big grape guy had Tangie for years.  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.
 
Topic 42 fyre festival: Fyre Festival was a failed music festival which was planned to happen in 2017 on Bahamas. The festival was marketed through a number of social media channels, but the organisers did not deliver what they had promised the attendees in terms of accommodation and other infrastructure, and many of the billed artists never showed. The festival was the topic for several documentaries in 2019. I want to hear first person accounts of the festival, interviews with people associated with the festival, and about the legal repercussions.
0:  Agencies in orders, right? So no longer. Do you have to have the middleman? I think Billy and the documentary says he had to pay somebody to talk to job rule then had to pay another guy to talk to John Woo. And so he said know what rather than going into this method. Let's just cut the middleman out and let's create something where I can talk directly to the artists have their schedule and say can I booked you on a Surface? Great idea. I think it's a great idea to promote the site. They decide to create a festival. Hence the  The title fire Festival which would which was supposed to be sort of like a Coachella but on a deserted island island that he said he had owned in the Bahama in the Bahamas, but it wouldn't they want they want to throw a music festival in the Bahamas. Yeah. So promote the app. Absolutely. That's what it that's what they want. That's what they want to do. Yeah, and they figured so they were smart about it.

They said listen rather will get some marketing teams. But the biggest way to promote something now is through Instagram just like you said it would fashion over the  Way to do it. Let's go through influences. So they have 10 supermodels like top-of-the-line. Super model. Chanel Iman is one of them Bella Hadid was one of them and they said you know, what? Can you just put up this orange burnt Square as the logo for what we're about to do right and every day at this time. Can you put it up and they do it and it gains traction and hashtag it fire festival and then they do something really
2:  Smart right they say hey, who's the most popular person at the time or one of the most popular persons or families at the time Kardashians and they reach out to Kendall Jenner and tell her listen. We're going to give you $250,000. If you could just say you're coming to the fire Festival to promote it. So they paid they paid Kendall Jenner $250,000 to put a post up just just to say I'm excited about fire Festival. Right? Right. She does it and I'm  The tickets sell out within 10 hours, they sell out so fast that they have to start making other accommodations. Like listen. I know you got the tickets for the festival. Here's the VIP passes then those sell out and they realize that they don't really have the money to do this. Then they have to start coming up with other ideas. Now, you gotta VIP bracelet and it's a whole Saga. It's an unfortunate story because the idea on the surface they of the app was great the execution of the festival horrible a lot of people.
3:  DM me a tray of culture cast I usually reserve the official like Instagram account for anything related to the podcast. You guys can always reach out to me on my personal account a temuco POTUS if you want to as well, but okay with all that being said, let's get into this episode. So today we have on the festival finesse ER his name is Brian, but that is basically like his YouTube name. That's what he goes by the festival finesse. ER you guys can most likely find him roaming around a music festival hanging out on the  Mosh Pit front and center he wears these bright tie-dye shirts with his logo on them. He is a Jersey native to is awesome. So that's been really cool. We both have lived near each other which is really cool. We hung out at Ever After Festival. So he's in some of my Vlogs if you guys want to go check him out. And yeah and he's a content creator. He's got some really awesome Vlogs and music festival tips. That's his whole thing. He's really just trying to show people how they can finesse music festivals. And again, he's very into bass music.
4:  My partner and my brother built from scratch. He's an engineer. So they started using that to live broadcast all of their music events. So they hire us to go in and install that and they use it for the three days at the festivals on from there. Once we got into that world. I was shooting a lot of my own personal films at the time. I was shot one in Hawaii and the island of Kauai and I showed it to one of the guys on the production team at Red Bull TV. Well,  we were at one of the festival's just doing broadcast and they really liked it. So I kind of kept on them and kept sending them some of the passion projects that I was working on for Film Production in the hope that I could shoot some of the recap videos for their music festivals and lucky enough about two years ago. They finally had an opportunity at one of their big festivals and they got us to produce there after movie, which is basically like a recap of the entire Festival so
5:  we were at one of the festival's just doing broadcast and they really liked it. So I kind of kept on them and kept sending them some of the passion projects that I was working on for Film Production in the hope that I could shoot some of the recap videos for their music festivals and lucky enough about two years ago. They finally had an opportunity at one of their big festivals and they got us to produce there after movie, which is basically like a recap of the entire Festival so  Equally the job is to run around the festival shoot all the artists. You have a pass that lets you go anywhere, which is really really cool as a fan of music. That is something I feel really lucky to do so run around shoot everything and make a two-minute recap of the entire Festival in order to drive ticket sales for the following year. So on that in hindsight, it really makes me pump that I went out and did those personal projects that kind of had no point. I mean I paid for my own trip to Hawaii and
6:  If that I want to share with you guys, so now we can get into the episode which I'm super super pumped about. So this past weekend, I actually had the opportunity to attend my first bass music festival and my first music festival in Canada. So two and one which is incredible and so there were a lot of first and I really hope to do a lot of Festival reviews here on this podcast. I wanted to dedicate an episode fully to talking about this experience what it was like so that you guys are a little bit more informed if you want to check this Festival out next year, you know a little bit  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.
7:  The feedback and pretty much just realized it was not the right fit for them. So they are heading to South Florida to find a new home. It sounds like they are pretty much in contract with someone. They just haven't announced it yet. So I will definitely keep you guys updated on where they actually end up being but I think this is Bittersweet for a lot of people it was bittersweet when it left its home that it was at forever. But Ultra is such like an iconic festival and they they are known for having amazing production and giving you the best possible Festival.  Perience. So if Virginia Key Beach wasn't the right thing then I think it was a good idea to move. So I'm really curious to hear where they end up and how that will change the overall experience of the festival. I'm glad that they're finding a solution and they're not going away. I didn't think that would happen. Anyway, you know, it's a worldwide Festival they happen in all different countries around the world, but that was a huge thing that happened in EDM news this week. Okay, so a couple music announcements the things that stuck out to me most recently.
8:  I've been playing with a couple of the guys in your band for you know, since since you started really playing music seriously or even before you started playing music seriously, and yeah, it kind of it kind of feels like, you know, the organic nature of what you're doing and what you're expressing is is really working. Well, so really looking forward to having you out at Blue Ox. I'm hoping that you're going to really love the festival and hang out there for a while as well. Yeah, we tried to cultivate an artist friendly artist-driven Festival.  Well, you know when we go out on the road, there's certain things we love and we kind of hope to bring that into Blue Ox are you also involved in booking and making a festival? It's been a while. So a couple years back me and my friend Erica libero started at a festival and like we had this idea that was just like it wasn't a genre specific Festival. But basically the only requirement was that every band had to have a female or female identifying person.
9:  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.  Blogs on my YouTube channel, which will be going out the end of this week and over the weekend. I got so much footage you guys I really went in this year. So it was also my first media pass which is super exciting literally was one of my main goals and I can't it feels surreal that that happened like when I started all this I was like, oh my God if I could create content and just travel to music festivals and do that like as a job, that would be my goal. So to actually do that this past weekend and be able to come back and have all this in
 
Topic 43 hong kong protests: Since early 2019, more or less continuous protests have taken place in Hong Kong, to mark popular displeasure with various aspects of power shifting from the local governing council to the Chinese central government. Students from the many Hong Kong universities have been at the forefront of the protests. I want to know more about who is protesting along with the students and what the popular sentiment in the general Hong Kong population is.
0:  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that
1:  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.
2:  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.  With cheap drums up just avoid the protest.
3:  he actually talks about Hong Kong here. And I'm gonna as it he was in he was in Hong Kong as I write from my four-star hotel and calm in Hong Kong which cost me a mere $25 per day I cannot but think about how erroneously risk is priced into the market when I arrived high at Hong Kong airport was eerily quiet with tourist avoiding it unbeknownst to them. However Hong Kong continues to be one of the safest place place.  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.
4:  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that  Hong Kong Polytechnic University and when they tried to storm it there was a fierce resistance. So people inside the university were they ended up barricading themselves into the school and to the university and fighting back with like petroleum bombs and arrows and Molotov cocktails. It was extremely interesting to watch and these people are fighting for
5:  By this point here is what the protesters still want one the withdrawal of the right description used about the 12th of June protests to an amnesty for all arrested protesters 3 and independent inquiry into alleged police brutality for universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong's chief executive and legislative Council and five the resignation of Carrie Lam.  I'm confused. China has one of the largest military forces. So why haven't they just taken Hong Kong by force? Well while this would spark a massive backlash in the International Community the actual main reason China have kept pushing to completely take control over Hong Kong is due to the fact that this would destroy their proposition to unify Taiwan under there one country two systems rule the opposite of already unfolded in Hong Kong have led to popularity leaning towards the governing party in Taiwan who favor continued Defiance of Beijing China.
6:  So as people may or may not have been paying attention the situation in Hong Kong has not stopped. So I talked about this months back. I mean probably four or five months ago talking about the situation in Hong Kong how I legitimately did not see a Way Forward except confrontation or there's really only two ways the situation is going to resolve itself. Either Beijing is  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.
7:  So but how would John so how would China starting riots make them appealing to Hong Kong intern doesn't just show that they can't control them.  The Chinese government had one the protesters to not play with fire not to underestimate the firm resolve the central government and not to mistake restraint for weakness. China could also be making the association that the Hong Kong government alone can't deal with such manic. So it is required for China to step in by the tenth week of protests. The airports are shut down due to protests on the 11th of August and the foot on the 4th of September Carrie Lam announced that she would withdraw the extradition brought together, but protesters said it was too little too late.
8:  So Harry, what will be the most plausible outcomes to come from the protests? Well based on my research. I found three plausible outcomes the most plausible outcomes of all of these is that the authorities will wait out the protesters to avoid a Not to cause a nonviolent approach. So what Research indicates this way? Well, I think the main reason for this is being the most possible outcome is because both the Hong Kong and Chinese government's don't want to have on have the need to end of intervene directly.  Also, the chances are that the outcome will not be very positive either party if they decide to go to a more violent now, so what about some other less popular ideas. Well, one of these other possible outcomes to the situation is that Beijing intervenes directly which means bringing the military in what makes this outcome less likely for some reason is how it direct intervention could end badly for both countries is one because it would Mark the end of the one country two systems that which was promised to Hong Kong by the former British colony as well.
9:  I'm confused. China has one of the largest military forces. So why haven't they just taken Hong Kong by force? Well while this would spark a massive backlash in the International Community the actual main reason China have kept pushing to completely take control over Hong Kong is due to the fact that this would destroy their proposition to unify Taiwan under there one country two systems rule the opposite of already unfolded in Hong Kong have led to popularity leaning towards the governing party in Taiwan who favor continued Defiance of Beijing China.  Want to take control of Taiwan and wants to have the one country two systems, but the events in Hong Kong are really preventing them from getting that.
 
Topic 44 thanksgiving comedy special: I remember hearing on the radio a comedy special recorded for Thanksgiving by Jack Benny.  Can I find it as a podcast?
0:  And we don't do things that are special. I might have special needs like a learning disorder something. We don't do special positive right dude special a special exception right not special positive. Yeah. So there was something psychological and also I started out as like stand-up like open mics like waiting in line, like riding dumb jokes, like just sort of dumb early 20s, whatever and then I  I got out of that and I got into the Groundlings and an Acme theater and improvisational comedy and then I got into Kimmel and radio and MTV and you know Comedy Central and blah blah blah and it just sort of you know stand up was like something you'd try to beginning and then you'd move on and then if you got a paying gig like he got into syndicated radio or Comedy Central whatever then again who would go back and do stand-up and so was always
1:  I think I'd have to go with Christmas. I feel like Christmas is more of a season so you can enjoy it more and when they went thanksgivings approaching there's really not any good Thanksgiving movies to watch their great Christmas movies watch and they're great Holi movies watch but what do you watch leading up to Thanksgiving?

Good morning. I mean there are a lot of like black. Do you watch black comedies girl?

7:  What does Thanksgiving look like in our families any fun Thanksgiving Traditions that we implemented this year Thanksgiving so much and it's a two-eyed honestly kind of funny because we lived out of state and closer to family not closer to family different years and I just I love experiences of both. Like I'll always love spending time with my family, but there's something about being away from family and creating a family Thanksgiving with close friends. That is that will always be special memories for us, you know. Yeah. I know a lot of times you're not everyone's close to their families, but  Having the chance to choose that and to make it into something because Thanksgiving can be kind of you can get homesick during that time. You're not my family. So I haven't even thought about it that way. Yeah, I loved just finding like a friendsgiving dinner is so fun to do and to put on and we did that we're far but we usually just switch on and off with me husband's family and do it that way. What about you guys? Yeah Thanksgiving. I feel like is I guess a couple of New Traditions that have been kind of
8: Not sure for this episode coming, right? It was supposed to be a Thanksgiving special but we were measuring now, please enjoy our fish action of bending in that's good Hunter now, don't you all stand away when the little girl has come on a town.  To all know which name Bambi come on attack. Oh Boris. Do you want to go hunting for Thanksgiving? Yeah, we need to go hit and so we can eat a turkey. But okay, I can give it a try. I've never tried it before so I can give it a try look good baby, which view could you want to take? You want to take your Lamborghini?
9:  Giving I understand that Christmas is more Universal International. I say this is a Jewish person nevertheless. Let's extend the holiday music season and not get sick of Mariah Carey and sync by Thanksgiving by introducing a whole new catalog of tunes November 1st. Let's hit press play on the Thanksgiving anthem by Kelly Clarkson Kelly. I'm putting you on notice these write a song If this take is a car lot.  Not I just walked by one and I did a double take ice above. What's what's going on over here. Now your walk by to look at the sticker price, but I need you to come running out of the office and say can I interest you in this take today? So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a vision or better yet a sound for this you need to convince Thanksgiving music take a test drive right now. Okay. I think we can agree. The Thanksgiving TV special is also underrated. However those which we do have our fantastic Monica with the turkey on top.
 
Topic 45 drafting tight ends: I heard a podcast about strategies for drafting tight ends in football.  I’d like to find it again.
0:  And to play tight end and that obviously worked out tremendously as he was Pro Football Focus is number one graded Tenon and all of college football last year from receiving standpoint. And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.
1:  10 times last year pretty ridiculous what you know speaking of tight ends Tom before we get into our rankings. We really should break down the some of the news that's come out today. Apparently the Giants are sending an MRI of Evan engram foot to dr. Robert Anderson. Who's one of the foremost foot specialists in the country. We have no update on that right now, but it does appear that the Giants are concerned about Evan engrams foot injury. Which would I mean look, he's a top  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.
2:  Mr. Watt is going to start filling in kind of a tight end / full-back position. So that's intriguing me dude. I mean, it's like fun training yard football. But like the guy hasn't played tight end. I don't know intriguing it will see if it were a lot of fans. A lot of fans have been throwing up the let's turn on the gates Pat signal and bring them home, but I just didn't know I just don't know what what that does for us.  So if that makes us better, you know, well, it'd be nice to see Gates back just you know on a personal level, but I know that they have let's say they promoted tight end Steven Anderson to the squad and I overheard him. Yeah, me neither Matt. So Cole was a tight end coming to the practice squad and hate Kyle, who else is coming to the price? I remember something you said a couple weeks ago would be kind of fun. What who's on our practice squad now my boy Quentin
3:  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.  Might wanna wanna might want to stash somebody here this week Mike a sickie is you know, kind of emerging here a little bit no offense, but that doesn't really do any good this week because they're owned by but you know, maybe Jared Cook was dropped, you know, he's gonna finally get the see some extended play with Drew Brees here only really played five quarters with them to start the season here. So the other there's some guys out there even Jacob Hollister. We talked him up a little bit on the waiver wire podcast Russell Wilson has thrown 32% of his touchdown passes to
4:  I will say he caught it and then he when he landed on the ground if you went back and watched him. He was like, yeah, that's a bummer. There was no like oh God my season's over he acted like a tight in like, yep. Well that's gone. So you want to help me out will scoot off to the sidelines. It was like Cynthia any other player would have had a card out, you know card out there taking them off and he got helped off the field. So I hope he gets back. He's a he's a good good player and it's kind of interesting there talking about how  Mr. Watt is going to start filling in kind of a tight end / full-back position. So that's intriguing me dude. I mean, it's like fun training yard football. But like the guy hasn't played tight end. I don't know intriguing it will see if it were a lot of fans. A lot of fans have been throwing up the let's turn on the gates Pat signal and bring them home, but I just didn't know I just don't know what what that does for us.
5:  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.  Ago or marcedes Lewis before last season, you can get the blocking tight and or take them in brown for five or six take, you know, take the blocking tight end in wrote in round four or five or six next year. So I'm not concerned about the way Sternberg a looks. I agree with it. I think a year in an NFL strength and conditioning program is going to be a huge deal for him. But I think he's as advertised as well. I have a little bit of concern about him just in the sense that I thought he
6:  You know, I listen to I listen to you and hacks episode like parts of it heard my name called a couple times there and then actually got tanks from some of my buddies. Listen to the podcast saying do Davies Roshan you his podcast so, you know, there's been a little bit of tension between me and the podcast but I am happy to be on I had Pat fried Marathon. I don't know if you heard this one, but Pat was telling me that he's been  Watching tape of the great tight ends at Penn State, and he first of all he goes Pat goes, you know, I've been while I used to watch your tapes and that to me and I'm like Pat you didn't watch my tape, dude. No don't lie and then never happened. Then he goes. I've been watching my cassock he's tame and I said, I hope you're only watching the the pass catcher. I hope you're not watching them, but I want to start talking.
7:  AC Hayward on the outside so you know expectations should be a little bit lower for those guys. I think this is a spot where Darren Waller has to bounce back here. It's been kind of quiet here to catch games the last and the last two games for them so that you know, that's not going to cut it. I mean the tight end position has been very brutal here, but you know, he's got it that needs to bounce back and I know the numbers say this matchup isn't good, you know tight ends are averaging just like three-and-a-half catches against the Chargers this year.  But they've only faced the top tight ends they faced so far this year Jimmy Graham and Darren fell so, you know, sometimes the tight end numbers especially can be a little bit deceiving because you know, there's just not a lot of great Titan options in the league. So this should be a good tight end game though. I mean, we've probably touch on the the Chargers passing game here a little bit. It's shaping up pretty well hit a fairly Rivers is you know, he's his numbers of bounce back here. He's just had you know poorly
8:  In time. So now the defense can't play either thing. It's defensive coordinators are paid millions and millions and millions of dollars to figure shit out. I'll be excited to see if they can figure this one out with because Harbaugh, I think this is almost like a beautiful mind type thing where he's like, well if we have 45 tight end zone we have I explosive wide receiver and we can get that rookie. The guy. Yeah Hollywood brown people talk about will get him yet. So we have the Deep threat. We have the explosive if we want and then we have all these big guys that can block.  Then potentially just catch passes if they need to and we got a guy that can run faster and everybody playing quarterback and he can throw a little bit we might be unstoppable. It feels like Car Bomb might have pieced together something that is going to be tough to stop. I think I think you guys should respect that. I just don't see what's so hard to figure out because Booger McFarland told me on Monday night that tight ends either run around. I've heard that before not that hard to see it's hard. It's so hard not to say that. I mean, I did say
9:  And make sure to follow me. So you never miss an episode.  Welcome into the atom Brenneman show life in the red zone. I'm Adam brennaman, and I appreciate you guys tuning in today.

Topic 46 missouri quilt mom: I listened to a podcast about a stay-at-home mom in Missouri who opened a quilt company and I would like to hear it again.
0:  Yeah, there's one I'm working on right now. I just stretched it yesterday and I haven't posted it yet. And I'm like so sad about it. I don't know if I want to quilt it this year. Oh my gosh, because I want to revisit it. I love it so much more adorable. But you gift these things are these gifts are they like things that you hang onto like what you know, yes, I do. Give away. Like I make a lot of baby quilts.  When my ma is have babies and stuff like that. But yeah, so a lot of the ones that I make are just like I'm making up the pattern. So yeah, I just I just make the I did give one away to oh, who's the girl who started PMG holla when her mom died, I think I sent her a quilt because I'm so grateful for like the groups that came out. I don't I'm not on PMG more. Yeah. Yeah all this whole connection that we
1:  To do these quilts, uh-huh. It probably does but it doesn't feel like it because I don't know. It's sort of like it takes all this time to do a marathon right like you right now. Yeah, well steps and totally while you're doing the little steps you enjoying them so much. You don't realize they're all coming together to make this greater thing, you know. Yeah, and so you don't think about you know all the hours you just think about the how fun the process is, you know, yeah actually get really sad when it starts to die down.  Yeah, there's one I'm working on right now. I just stretched it yesterday and I haven't posted it yet. And I'm like so sad about it. I don't know if I want to quilt it this year. Oh my gosh, because I want to revisit it. I love it so much more adorable. But you gift these things are these gifts are they like things that you hang onto like what you know, yes, I do. Give away. Like I make a lot of baby quilts.
2:  You should I don't know if we could all yeah, like one day you can teach me something very simple and I can totally you know, I actually made for you know, the the crafting group used to be p.m. Crafters or whatever and I actually made a quilt pattern for beginners on that actually. Oh, yeah. Yeah, should I actually made one for people who want to learn how and it's like instructions on people who don't know how to sew so if you're interested I will take a look.  How long were you doing it since you were a little to no, no, I didn't learn to so tall. I was pregnant my mom. My mom. Is this the seamstress and she came up and showed me how to make like sheets for the baby crib and stuff. So we did her nursery and then oh just like any other thing, you know, I just fell into it hardcore just can't just kind of do some kissing can't like there's no like halfway with you. Yeah.
3:  Beautiful quilts. I have ever seen it blows my mind to even first of all to create in your mind like what you want it to look like. I'm sure you know have patterns and other ideas from from people and things that you've seen But just to even have an imagination to create these gorgeous things and then to meticulously go through these I mean, it must take hours and hours and hours to put the I mean days and days and months and months to do that.  To do these quilts, uh-huh. It probably does but it doesn't feel like it because I don't know. It's sort of like it takes all this time to do a marathon right like you right now. Yeah, well steps and totally while you're doing the little steps you enjoying them so much. You don't realize they're all coming together to make this greater thing, you know. Yeah, and so you don't think about you know all the hours you just think about the how fun the process is, you know, yeah actually get really sad when it starts to die down.
4:  When my ma is have babies and stuff like that. But yeah, so a lot of the ones that I make are just like I'm making up the pattern. So yeah, I just I just make the I did give one away to oh, who's the girl who started PMG holla when her mom died, I think I sent her a quilt because I'm so grateful for like the groups that came out. I don't I'm not on PMG more. Yeah. Yeah all this whole connection that we  I have has changed my life seriously so much. So like things like that I give them away. But usually it's just about the process of learning how to sew because I like to write my own patterns and then sell those so that's oh so do you you sell patterns? Yeah. Well that was kind of like something I was doing there for a while, but honestly, I don't know if I care that much right? Right, right. I felt like I was justifying all that time by having an end to it, but actually I don't care well.
5:  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to  Time to figure that out. I was listening to the love our podcast and they had some guests on there and they were talking about how like in this when Melissa was going through her similar transition as far as like her career path to becoming an entrepreneur in doing out things. She has this thing where she's like space and Grace like give me the space in the grace to be able to figure things out. But her guest on the podcast was like not only space and Grace but
6:  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to
7:  It just happened definitely had to go on some awful dates before I met my husband, but we are very happily married and I am I guess thankful to Tender but I started hashtag mommy status podcast because I love Mom podcast. One of my favorites is Mom brain if you guys have listened to it.  You guys know I'm talking about if you have it. You need to check it out. I started going on walks after I had my son and I found that podcast and I was obsessed it like which is so great to listen to other moms and get helpful tips and insight into motherhood like even though this is my second time around having a baby. I had my daughter so young I had her when I was let's see, so I turned 22
8:  I love I love hearing that because I think there's a lot of people in our audience right now who kind of fall under that same almost like ideology. It's like this is what my parents did and this is what I'm going to do two and that's not a bad thing. I mean, my mom was a stay-at-home mom my dad work from home. So that was like a different thing that my friends had but oh that sounds fun. It was a lot of fun because like there were times. It's like Dad. Let's go outside and play baseball and he would drop what he was doing.  He would throw the ball with me in the backyard and it was the greatest. I love it. Yeah, it was so good. Ellie's parents were the same way. Her mom was a stay-at-home. Mom. Her dad went to work and look at us now. We're full time YouTuber. So it's like it's a little bit different but you know, that's not to say that it's a bad thing. It's just I feel like a lot of people need to hear that. It's okay to do something different. There's more than one right way to do things and I love the way that you found it out.
9:  Okay, and so then my Five-Year Plan is so I spent seven years living a dream. Basically. Yeah, it was a dream seven years living that dream and then I quit abruptly to be a stay-at-home mom. And so the thing for me is like I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't quit my job to have  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that
 
Topic 47 sci-fi author interview mars: I heard this interview with a sci-fi author who wrote a book or books with “Mars” in the title, but I can’t recall his name.  I’d like to find it again.
0:  If you missed our first podcast, you can check out the interview with Joe siple a tanker dot f m / Black Rose writing and upcoming interviews in the two weeks will be the author of the fiction book of the Year managed care. Joe Barrett is the author and that will be an exciting interview. So hope you tune in for the third episode. This is Reagan Roadie the  Host of Heard It Through The Rose Vine signing off those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.
1:  Awesome. Thanks again for coming on and hope you continue to write wonderful books that we can publish. Oh, I will I promise. Thank you so much for having me.  If you missed our first podcast, you can check out the interview with Joe siple a tanker dot f m / Black Rose writing and upcoming interviews in the two weeks will be the author of the fiction book of the Year managed care. Joe Barrett is the author and that will be an exciting interview. So hope you tune in for the third episode. This is Reagan Roadie the
2:  Harris Klobuchar it so I'm just like naming the woman. Sorry if that's what yeah from the boat. So we read so we read the blogs Madam president female candidates interview, which excluded Marianne Williamson, even though she's pulling better than Kirsten gillibrand. Yeah, which I mean if there was ever an example of the media dictating and brainwashing what we think this is it people not having Marianne Williamson and this interview was  was your biggest fucking mistake because this all the interview quotes are boring as hell. Yeah, and if you would had Marianne Williamson in there, like I would have enjoyed reading the story. It's so bad. Whoever the author is is also just like like a shitty writer like it's like yes, it's full of like like I don't know but she keeps the kind of making the story about herself and being like, well, this is so I got when Hillary didn't get elected. It's like bitch that was like three years ago, like get over it. No one can
3:  List of bye. Bye. Bye, you know, that's it's just such a turn-off. It is a turn-off. One of the things I do is I ask people to take a picture of themselves with my book and I'll create collages and I'll just Express enthusiasm. I love seeing people's beautiful faces with my book so you can you can share those types of things. You're not overtly selling the book but people will read the title and the like that sounds interesting and so I  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people
4:  That's when they were kind of conversations about Acquisitions happening. So like Verizon buying us whatever but it was awesome because especially because when a brand is kind of going through a rebranding it's a weird time to be there because it doesn't feel the most stable at times but your voice is heard you're like involved in a lot of cool like brainstorming situations, like they're really open to ideas and I was always very outspoken so  Leslie I added my internship there. Like I said I did as I did at Cosmo I did everything I was in on beauty shoots. I was sat through like interviews with celebrities just to like see what it was like and get a feel for it. I did some celebrity interviews like over the phone or something like that and I wrote articles and like yeah not all of them are exciting but like I loved it was so cool went back to school and while I was at school I continued obviously
5:  A 2012 event Nat Geo Adventurer of the year. He is a author of 13 books. He's a motivational speaker, you know adventure of the grand sort of like, you know cycling around the world for four years as well as just micro Adventures that he's talked about in his blogs and his books and now his podcast and so this interview with allister's is all about the different channels of sharing his story how he kind of has approached each what's going  on on across the you know, the bookie just launched the podcast and just as general perspective on life and how to fuse Adventure into it. It was really great chat. Yeah. I can't even believe it like it. Was it spoke to me on such a deep level. So I know it's going to resonate with you all as well. So, please enjoy our interview with Alistair Humphreys Alistair. So good to have you on the Stoke cast. How you doing?
6:  You see what's going on. Nobody really knows what's going on except for everybody that's involved. But you keep bringing it to group to group 2 group to group and Sarita and by Sir Arthur and by Sarita and my father-in-law you started more shit. Yeah, it's it's always the readers like especially like doing like my interviews with other authors. Like we kind of all agree like oh, yeah, it's the readers because they're coming to your inbox with some shit. Like I remember somebody  at one point. I just didn't stop checking my messages my inbox because it was always something like even recently like I posted something they had nothing to do with nothing like and then it's another thing. We just have to understand that authors do have lives outside of the industry like outside of
7:  Look, but it's not good to you right now because you your mind and just blocked out but when I do read a book and I read has blocked out, I just binge this Arthur so so who's your goes to water for situations? Like this are like I normally try a new author when I have read his blog. Honestly, what would make you try a new author like what attracts you to new Authors?  Well for one, I really don't know nothing about them. So it's like I'm taking a chance all the time, but normally I will scroll on Amazon and I'm always reading reviews. Right so I'll be like, okay and then I look at covers. So one more third that I got connected to last year. She's one of my favorites now and I saw her own book title on Amazon and I like the people and I like the own the
8:  Reaching out and saying hey, I just saw you on the news. Like I want to get you connected with this guy. So before I left Kalamazoo I had about 25 interviews lined up. So then when I finally left I had messaged all the dads on my route South and said, hey, like I'm finally on the road. I know it's been you know eight months since you've heard from me, but I'm finally on the road, you know, this is kind of my agenda if you're in town, I'd love to love to interview you so the first dad in Elkhart I had lined up ready to go. He's an  Amish dad had them lined up ready to go drove down there first night slept in a plan if it's parking lot woke up the next morning. Like hey, like let's do this interview.

9:  No, I would never want to be locked up in a cage and treat it like a pet by a Mafia Boss, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to read that story. How do you find criticism of dark romance is kind of sex is given that authors of dark romancer primarily women while a male author like George RR Martin is lauded even though his books are full of rape scenes.  You don't necessarily I think that a lot of it dark romance you can get away with a lot more when you write fantasy or sci-fi or even historical because you know, it's a lot easier to accept an alien who's abducting a woman and taking her against the will her will rather than say, you know, a modern-day billionaire doing it.

All made from like unicorn hair and a and reindeer and reindeer quills or something and we sat there and watched Chiraq that sounds like a Spike Lee fantasy sequence from like it - like when we when we make the movie about the podcast we're mean Kevin play ourselves and is directed by Spike Lee. Yes. It does not please himself. Yeah the walk to the Spike Lee screening. It will be on the that that standard Spike Dolly shot where we're floating over the ground.

I had to leave in this like to on our into it an hour and a half into it because I had to go be on CNN. I was on my phone during the screening trying to get out of it because I was doing all these text messages and emails trying to get out of it and they said no and I was like, I was like a half second way from texting. Well, then screw all y'all I quit the entire thing. Like I don't need to quit his job. That's segment know the CNN show working for CNN. That's Show Business.
2:  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.  Story of a pivotal scene where Jesus who's played by Future NBA Hall of Famer Ray. Allen is supposed to be his father in one-on-one game. It starts with you asking Spike a question about the movie swell, and there's a fizzle famous story and I feel like we want we've heard it from other people but here from the from you the one-on-one game. Yes. All right.
3:  percent off federal and state filing  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.
4:  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.  In mounts and he walks in by himself. No Handler. No extra person. He doesn't say too much and it wasn't till he sat down and we actually started recording and he goes what's up young brothers and we all laugh but I realize oh, he's here to have a good time. Like he and he that's what he let us know. He'd listen to the podcast more than one episode and he reference ever there episode. I mean, I understand this and I think Henderson the only reason this podcast can exist is because of the four movies that Spike did with Denzel. Yeah.
5:  I really liked it. Yeah. Yeah, so I guess the only thing left to do is to like conclude this phase. Yeah done with Phase 1 phase one phase two. What is the first movie of phase 2 the first movie of phase 2 is Iron Man 3. Oh cool. So that should be fun. I think that is an underappreciated Marvel movie. It's not one that is talked about but let's just kind of go down the list of movies that we've watched so far and give our scores so and Iron Man, oh and you could  In scores now if you want it. Yeah, we can change scores. I gave Iron Man and 8 out of 10. Hmm. I also did get given an 8 out of 10 and our guest garcy gave it a 7 out of 10. Okay. Incredible Hulk was the second movie. I gave it a 3 Keenan gave it a to and Garcia three. I feel like that that definitely stays that was the stinker of the yeah, the whole thing's rough. Yeah, then Iron Man 2 what you gave an eight I gave a 7. Hmm
6:  Could this would be fun to do different musical pieces to but do it not necessarily all classical like maybe scores two movies for some other movies Disney move dance music or whatever. Yeah. Relax. No. No. No, I'm sorry being scores to other Disney movie Reza on it Rizza the Wu-Tang Clan. I thought you were he composed all I got I got  Bill soundtrack I know
7:  Logan I already knew you won this one, this is a no-brainer. Yeah, of course five to seven. Yeah Dark Knight is the number three, so I brought it up seven times you brought it up six times. It scores a hundred and twenty-four. Wow, so it destroyed all other scores. Mmm. The next closest is Malcolm X which I was blown away by its come up that many times. Wow, but seven and seven piece. Okay, and then Road to Perdition is Numero Uno. Yeah.  No, surprise. No surprise and that was what provoked it how many times and that is eight me seven you but it's score 70. So dark night was a 124. Wow. So dark night is always at the top when it comes up. That's a thing. It crushes the conversation when it's in the conversation. Yeah, it being a comic book movie though moves it down a little bit but it just doesn't come up as often as Road to Perdition Road to Perdition 15 mob movies. Is there a crime movies are former surprised. I wasn't on the top 10 list that we that we talked about. There's a what I'm sorry, it's Sarah.
8:  and then do it. Yeah, there's eldest go another battery both of moral victory for themselves. I'm feeling keeps going for baskets on the NBA great in my hall of fame future Hall of Famer. I feel like you can see when he scored the first basket like real go. Wait. What the hell? Yeah. You just sitting Courtside again. Another God. What a great game the thing. I really really like about this clip is it shows how much people like love Denzel?  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.
9:  Just barely above nice. All right for me. I enjoyed it a lot more anytime. I movies unique. It's going to almost get like a full point bump for me every single time. Okay for me this movie's coming in. This is my favorite movie of the year get out of here, but also my least favorite movie because it's the only one we've done so far. So it's an eight point seven. All right, you can you can have any point seven but our combines  Score will be nowhere near that. Alright fair enough. We'll throw it on the list are in the description. So so let's let's talk about this shared score real quick. I want to go.

We're getting to it right after this you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of tv top now let the episode 7. Whoa, how how how did we get there so fast, it's a good one.
4:  I'm being on the firing range in the shooting range for hours on end. You know, this thing's do impact you after a while but you know, every veteran in experiences something to where it's going to impact them in the long haul and the and the more resources that the government is putting towards the study of Veteran well-being while they're in the military and getting a Baseline and really focusing in on the long-term effects of military career.  No, it's good that the although we're behind the curve as a country on it. The people are still there starting to now get some unique benefits. I mean the sure even though there's a lot of work to be done at the VA. But the VA is yeah open their eyes more. It's got it's gotten a lot better and I can say from personal experience and I've told you guys so if you caught it been out for 1 year and 1 I'm like a I'm a planner. I don't leave anything to chance if I can and even before I got out of the Navy I had all my VA paperwork submit it.
5:  Time so I went in I was always interested in going in the military, but I was never motivated enough to go right lose the weight because it's hard. Yeah get in. Yeah, so I ended up going in 2008 went to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri for basic training. And while I was what I was in there I got held back in what they called the like the maps is  kind of like orientation you go in for your shots and stuff, right? Okay. Also give you like eye exam medical exam and all that and I was blind in my but well not blind but I could definitely not see very well out of my right eye going into the military, but I was really like devoted wanting to go in. Yeah. And so what I did was I cheated I cheated just to get to basic training. So because I knew you know, you cover up your left eye and you're right on you that I couldn't see out of my right arm.
6:  Just sort of talking about how witchcraft has has been clear. Heather had been queer witches. It's pretty it's pretty short. It's a short sweet little article. I'm trying to find it has a really good quote about a quote for some queer witches. They may find that they're witchcraft helps them to shape their identities as queer individuals in quote. Just talking about sort of the connection between between basically your queerness.  So then your witchcraft your practice helping you sort of shape each other. I think specifically in this case. They're talking about based on the quote. I just gave you there. They're specifically talked about witchcraft helping you shape your eye your personal identity, which is fair. I feel like it can go both ways. I feel like you can use your identity and also shape your craft. I say as a person who still hasn't really explored it as deeply as they should but I like I like the the notes and it sort of leads into the next article I have
7:  So so, you know, I got involved with some organizations that do help veterans. Some of the bigger ones like the American Legion the VFW Veterans of Foreign Wars Fair the DAV and you know, a lot of a lot of those eight, you know, you walk in and as soon as you walk in the room you in a room full of people that experience a lot of the stuff that you did. Yeah, you know and is really cool too because some of them they do have some older members like older veterans, you know.  But it's kind of like humbling to know like whatever it is that I went through. It's nothing compared to the you know World War Two veteran and I'm sitting next to it. Yeah. We're that Vietnam veteran that I'm sitting next to. Yeah, because you know, they're 40 50 years older than me or whatever the case might be and it's like, you know, they went through this when they were younger than I am now, right? They're still here, you know, so, you know how selfish would it be? I say selfish, but you know what?

9:  One of the one of the most incredible things about that if you remember I said I had two friends that I work with in nsw that went and work with their so I didn't end up working with them particularly, but I went to a team that was just just full of veterans from all different services and I think it's because well, it's a few reasons. I'll leave them out of this podcast in particular but one of the reasons is because  Because I think those people just really they want those challenges. They want to continue to be challenged because one of the things that comes up a lot in my podcast is at least people are just like what do I do? I don't know where to go now. I don't know. I don't know what to do. So I think I don't know what the percentage is, but there's there's got to be at least like I'm on a team of maybe 30 30 individuals and there's maybe at least 10 veterans out of that and
 
Topic 52 fauci interview: An article about COVID-19 referenced an interview with Dr. Fauci that took place when the virus had not yet reached the US.  I would like to listen to it.
0:  So I always so I also do off camera interviews like just for my job. So there's like  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.
1:  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview  View and the problem I have with all those interviews where they got these actual guys that like kind of like except Article 13. It's always like 10 minutes and they got two minutes to speak themselves and to respond. Maybe they got one minute. So if they ever are in a corner where they have to like say, oh my God, I'm actually deciding this because of this and that there was getting cut off. So what would be really interesting would be like a discussion where it like has no end like where they can really trapped and him so they would
2:  That they're sort of not buying the fact that it how did you know it was upstairs if you've never been upstairs and now you're still talking about not going upstairs, even though it clearly you clearly have bit upstairs, you know, it is a just digging his own hot. You're right and we've found this a lot with clients that are used to be in listen to clients that are used to people not interrupting them or questioning them and obviously prince Andrew is a prime example of that. The truth is a journalist is looking for an answer and whether it's a print interview a radio interview or in this case a TV interview.  You've got control of your answer. So you answer the question the way you want to answer and then you stop and this is not what happens with so many people in power is there used to be in listen to and they go on and on and on especially someone like Andrew who feels is got a point to prove and if I keep talking these guys are going to love me eventually because everyone loves me and that's the attitude he heard he just couldn't stop talking and we took we took as well about legal speak corporate speak. Yeah this sort of you know, this I was
3:  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's
4:  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's  And you know, that is the company right for me or not. I also just people not to run behind the package that they offer because if the work is not suitable for you, then there's no point in doing it as I say also while answering in an interview you have to make sure that you have eye contact with the interviewer because if you don't have it it it basically shows that you don't have any interest work in the company. That's what so yeah also before going going in some interview make sure that you look upon the previous.
5:  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.  I mean the two girls from Euphoria were amazing Paris Hilton was also one of my favorite epic just because not even from my own point of view, but others like my friends and co-workers and everybody were like you were so they said I was so myself on stage with her which just is awesome because so great you could tell that it was an entertaining interview of people thought that we vibed with each other totally. Um,
6:  No, I think that like these are companies that most people don't know the name of even if the you see like powered by out brain. It doesn't mean it doesn't register with you when you're on the site and anytime someone writes about them. I feel like whenever I come across an article about them. It's like these are the people who provide us with the lowest quality content. Nobody. Yeah. It's never like an appreciation for the place that tells you how to lose weight by eating beetles or whatever, right? So I say like, hey we want to do an interview with you guys and they were both like what specifically do you want to talk to us about and so I explained to them.  What I was interested in and they were like, yeah, we'll get back to you. But in the meantime, I was contacted by another person who had written one of these articles about Matt and Liz and she claims not to remember having written it but she told me about how the company she writes for uses. This specialized software that is specifically designed to find trending articles that are very popular that they can then just copy and throw up on their sites. It's called buzzsumo, which is the yeah. Why is it like in the
7:  Continue that audiobook and I will see now I can you know, how I can sell that service to like clients like once I myself get sold on that idea. I highly recommend to go listen to that audio book seller we Soul if you are connected with sales in any way and that will be my recommendation. So I listen to that audio book and Earl like before that. I also gave an interview on the Rohan I wrote a show which was a super amazing interview like trust me.  If it was one of the best interviews, I have ever given like give like multiple interviews on different different podcasts because you know, what happens is like this is the funnel. I'll explain you now that funnel which people having courses use and you know, they try to sell you like I'm calling this a funnel because it is a funnel but I haven't monetized it. So this is how it works people search on YouTube how to start a podcast or how to start a podcast in Hindi but how to start a podcast for free whatever they might search my video.
8:  You also have your own podcast, which I listen to all the time. Um, why don't you talk a little bit about that? So my podcast is called the real real and it's kind of like a play on words because the last real spelled r ee L like a highlight reel a reel of film. So what I thought when I was starting it was I want to start a podcast where I interview people and I didn't only want to interview super successful people. I didn't only want to  Interview like women I didn't only want to interview my friends. Like I wanted to interview a ton of people in different walks of life and I wanted it to be very very real sense the title but very much like not. Oh, how did you become super successful? I wanted it to be like, what are the real struggles of getting to where you are or you might not be where you want to be yet. But what are you doing to get there? Like I interview so many of my friends and different jobs that don't often get highlighted like my
9:  I don't know that somebody I would love to interview a roof. I have so many like Oprah lately. I'm obsessed with Oprah that bitch or just listening to her talk is so soothing nice to go watch for like old like shows. She was just changing the game and I would love Dr. That's true. But would you interview I went to or like Gary Vee. I really like him. He's an entrepreneur. It's like I would want to pick his mind and he's  Like so real. Yeah, so I would like to finally want him to call me out on my bullshit. But I feel like that's why I'm like thinking about celebrities. I want Oprah and I want Dave Chappelle. I want to interview both of them Seth Rogen. That's right - fuck. Yeah, bitch. The first one is a lot of The Breakfast Club. So a lot of The Breakfast Club interviews all these fucking people and there's another interesting is when we asked the word, I guess we're just going to wrap this up for now. This is just a little bit getting to know us.
 
Topic 53 recommended books for entrepreneurs: I was told about a podcast that recommended good books for entrepreneurs.  I’m trying to find that episode.
0:  Went we were grappling with and what we might have needed. I think that reading picture books can be an incredibly cathartic thing to I just recommended one to a student of mine who described an experience that she had had as a child and it reminded me so much of this book and I have no idea if she has kids or not, but I was like you need to read this book like get this book for yourself. You could be young at heart, you know. Yeah, I never cared for a good picture book on that note we do something.  Which you're familiar with since you listen to some episodes called feeds and reads where I get to pick your brain and get recommendations for myself about what to read and who to follow and stuff. Yes. So to start out. Is there anything what's the best thing you've seen on social media today or this week or the last time you were on social media? Yeah, so I have been actually trying to not be on social media. It quite as much I found that it's like just so much better for myself to not be on it, but
1:  Direction so you probably know this if you're part of Dropship lifestyle, but we talked a lot about how we audit are at accounts what we're looking for how we're looking for any different signs of weakness or strength and how we're optimizing because of that so I recommended John use a tool called a ahrefs.com and basically use that to do his organic auditing so you can see where your ranking for different products you could see what your competition looks like you  Could track things over time to see if you are organic results are going up or down and make adjustments from there. So I recommended John use that tool and build a system in in his business for monitoring that I also recommended like some easy wins. And one of them was just Outsourcing pagespeed optimization. So Google and everybody really cares about how fast your site loads went once somebody lands on it. So a lot of people try to do this all themselves.
2:  I years ago read the called the read aloud handbook by Jim to release. Oh, yes. I read that one. She wasn't yeah. Yeah, and then where she's just throwing it out there where one of our favorite books that both of us have recently read is called the read aloud family by Sarah Mackenzie. So she was inspired by Jim. Yeah. It's an incredible book that we both really recommend and we'll give you a lot of insight into  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so
3:  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so  We're going to talk about why do we even need to read aloud and some benefits from it? Yeah reading aloud is a great and easy way to help your children reach their full potential. What does that mean? I will so as I was Googling it that's like on therapists and education websites like it was everywhere. Yeah, like this is a huge Foundation the principle of a way to help your child to reach their full potential. It seems so simple right? It's kind of weird that something
4:  With it. But again, what do you got to lose but eating healthy but one day I was at the chiropractor and I heard this woman who had been in the hospital for four like on and off for weeks and she was pretty young probably in her forties maybe early 50s and she was explaining how sick she'd been to this the receptionist and I couldn't help but hear it. I was 2 feet away. So when I was done I said hey if you have you tried, you know celery  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and
5:  Open my eyes that say to a lot of the stuff that your your brand represents. Yes say in all honesty prior to that and I was one of those guys that had zero to know I like opinions or knowledge on any of these things. I was just one of those people. Yeah, and I actually when I found out I was interviewing you I got in touch with these people that they were  Is my gym actually there but moved to Australia and I was like, look, I'm interviewing new intervention. He does this on the other. Is there any resources you could watch I could watch that would you know really open my eyes? And actually they recommended a documentary. I mean, it's not about the food actually, it's more like the packaging. Yeah, the recommended a documentary called plastic ocean. Yeah, and I watched it the beginning the way and I haven't stopped thinking about it. Yeah.
6:  Our is right those those added hours that you're going to be putting in. I would put those into hiring somebody and training somebody and Building Systems for that person. So what I've seen happen to a lot of people is they will leave their jobs because they have a store that's doing great like John's is and then what will happen is they will just build jobs for themselves and they'll do more and more and more and basically start working the same as they used to except on their own business now nothing wrong with that.  But if this is really going to scale and get to two hundred thousand a month three hundred thousand five hundred thousand, then you know, John will need people supporting him. So again, I recommended his his new hours that he finds get invested into the the person or the people that are going to be part of this next phase of growth. So I talked about that a little bit. I'm not going to get into detail about our hiring process now simply for sake of time. We do want to keep these episodes episodes relatively short, but
7:  Is Google ads so Google ads is like the foundation of everything and what that means is most of our time goes into Google ads. So getting better at it actively monitoring it auditing our accounts when we hire people and we bring on contractors. Most of the work is supporting that right because that's the that's the number-one moneymaker everything else again supports that so what I recommended that John do too if instead of Google ads, you know, sir.  Search engine optimization is going to be his driver if that's where all the attention is going. If that's going to be the the main thing that everything else supports. What I recommended to him is he goes a step further with his product pages? So big thing that Google looks for is is this page? Right? Is this this website? Is this actually relevant and is this the best thing that will match for the person looking for it? So some things that I recommend instead of
8:  But if this is really going to scale and get to two hundred thousand a month three hundred thousand five hundred thousand, then you know, John will need people supporting him. So again, I recommended his his new hours that he finds get invested into the the person or the people that are going to be part of this next phase of growth. So I talked about that a little bit. I'm not going to get into detail about our hiring process now simply for sake of time. We do want to keep these episodes episodes relatively short, but  If you want to learn more about how we do hire check out module 7 of the Dropship blueprint that shows all of our automations and how we outsourced. But yeah, that was pretty much all my advice for John we wrapped up with me just you know telling him again how how happy I am for him because he's just made so much progress in relatively not allow them of time at all. So I know personally I am looking forward to meeting up with him in Prague, you know hearing more about his journey. What is it going to be and I think two months from now at that.
9:  Could track things over time to see if you are organic results are going up or down and make adjustments from there. So I recommended John use that tool and build a system in in his business for monitoring that I also recommended like some easy wins. And one of them was just Outsourcing pagespeed optimization. So Google and everybody really cares about how fast your site loads went once somebody lands on it. So a lot of people try to do this all themselves.  Which is fine when you're first starting but if you're up and running and you have things going on in your business and you were making money, I do recommend if your site's not fast, I do recommend hiring somebody that literally specializes in speed optimizations because they can usually go into your site make some tweaks seriously for like a couple hundred bucks and make it load dramatically faster. And when that happens Google will reward you with higher higher organic results. So I did recommend John do
 
Topic 54 bias in college admissions: I read an article that mentioned a podcast about bias in college admissions.  I would like to listen to it but I don’t know the name of the show.
0:  Huge differences from each other and it's really helped me understand privilege and bias and it's really just blowing my mind and it's written amazing. So it's so good such an interesting story and it is fictional, but I think it has very real it feels real when you read it. It's really good.  Okay love but we have a combination of fiction and historical and like current things but there is that thread that about judgment and and bias and objectifying other people and pushing a wow. Well, that's crazy. We did not talk about that before that's pretty fun. But they're important thing. Yes. That's all you Morgan part of Being Human. Yes. Alright. We are going to take a break and we'll come back with our self-help recommendations.
1:  Daughter and I don't understand I know the college experience because that was one of her excuses. Like I'm just here for the experience. You know, I just wanted I'll go to football games and she was when she mentioned class she was like, I don't really care about it. Yeah. I saw that man to you. She is a Creator on YouTube. So yes, I can in principle be getting Bank.  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.
2:  Okay, and and there was a some some stuff in my life. That was like not like less than ideal. And I took it my answer to it was like being angry and frustrated. That's why I like for me like playing football growing up was like a big way like letting out that anger, you know and like, you know, maybe a healthier way of the options. I had presented, you know, yeah and the answer for a while. I would kind of just like like put it away. You know, I just like, okay like and after doing that enough times. I became I think really out of touch with my emotions. Yeah and really like analytically and  Really driven, which I think has like some massive pros and some massive cons. Okay, right and so growing up and maturing and learning about the validity that emotions have in relationships. Yes. You can't eat like you have to listen to your heart. Yeah, and you can't only think and and I think that I think that it's better to make now. This is my bias. I think it's better to make decisions according more to logic to like and reason. Yeah then how you feel, but also I think and so I thought that for so long I also think that you
3:  This was really good. And I feel like I know a lot more about you now and hopefully our listeners do to and feel like they want to listen to her our next podcast episode. Yeah, please do please do follow our Instagram. Oh, yeah bold dot her. Yes. We're having well, I guess today is a Friday. It's gonna be out on Tuesday. But tomorrow we have our promo photo shoot for the podcast and  Very excited. Yeah, so those should be up on our Instagram right now. Yes, so go check it out. Go give us a follow. Yeah, if you want to join her campus and if anyone is going into college or is in college, her campus has chapters on college campuses all around the world. So if you're interested in writing articles and started talking about what we're talking about on this podcast, please look it up. It's a really cool opportunity.
4:  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.  And is the thing that specifically about this girl was the college experience like come on my you can have a college experience and not go to college. Yeah. I remember people criticize her for that because like you were like, why are you being so ungrateful? Like this is an opportunity. This is a blessing you're into a great College. Like why are you being so great for then? She apologized obviously people are gonna forget. Apparently. She apologized. Yeah, but I mean now when people know how she got it apparently, you know, Mom push her she may be grass out. That's how we do.
5:  But I definitely always tried to make sure I was seeing at least one of my friends every single week and it absolutely changed my mental and emotional health being able to have that time with a friend and spend time with them and just talk to them and not really be worried about school and just having that sort of like fellowship and a sense is just so important and I think I've mentioned this before and I think I mentioned in the last podcast but you know a lot of times in college. I've kind of just compared my  College life and my college situation and you know like my friends to a lot of people that I see on social media who have you know, they have like a big group message or big group me with like 20 other roles in it. And you know, they always have someone that they could be doing something with like no matter what time of day it is and you know always have someone to hang out with are always doing something every night or every weekend and I catch myself comparing myself to those people a lot of times, but I've realized that
6:  Really driven, which I think has like some massive pros and some massive cons. Okay, right and so growing up and maturing and learning about the validity that emotions have in relationships. Yes. You can't eat like you have to listen to your heart. Yeah, and you can't only think and and I think that I think that it's better to make now. This is my bias. I think it's better to make decisions according more to logic to like and reason. Yeah then how you feel, but also I think and so I thought that for so long I also think that you  Discount your feelings. You can't write them off totally. Yeah. And in fact, your feelings will tell you a lot of things that you know, but you might not be processing correctly the a super common relationship that probably a lot of people here nothing like a skin relationships. Do you think it's better to trust your gut and like your heart or what? You think it's both both? Okay. And so there's a balcony Mac. But yeah. Yeah, I think that in relationships a lot of people they're in a relationship. They're happy. It's like a good time. They like the
7:  This one is like recency bias for me. And if you really know me it wouldn't be that big of a surprise, but I really like a song off the new Tinashe album It's touch-and-go which is so relatable to me, which is kind of like a song about like relationships and the complexities and stuff like that. And for the most part that album I like it. It's just like she does too many kind of trap Beats for  Sure. She just keeps going in over the same kind of sound. She's like trying to hit a sound that's maybe a little over overdone at this point. Yeah, but that song is just like kind of a straight R&B song with like very melodic and blacks on it. And it's just like very nice very nice song nice smooth and so nice. That's that's what that's a good one.
8:  And it is a fictional story of a black nurse who is on trial for the murder of a white infant in her Care at a hospital and I'm just going to give you that because I don't want to go into the story. But I hope that Sparks your interest and it's just a story of seeing how we are the same as other people, but then also recognizing our  Huge differences from each other and it's really helped me understand privilege and bias and it's really just blowing my mind and it's written amazing. So it's so good such an interesting story and it is fictional, but I think it has very real it feels real when you read it. It's really good.
9:  Okay love but we have a combination of fiction and historical and like current things but there is that thread that about judgment and and bias and objectifying other people and pushing a wow. Well, that's crazy. We did not talk about that before that's pretty fun. But they're important thing. Yes. That's all you Morgan part of Being Human. Yes. Alright. We are going to take a break and we'll come back with our self-help recommendations.  If you haven't heard about anchor it's the easiest way to make a podcast in my opinion. Let me explain it's free.

Topic 55 malcolm x biography: I heard about a podcast biography of Malcolm X and I would like to listen to it.
0: Are we really free? Hell? No. No, we're not well.  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.
1:  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.  Of how everything he said back then still resonate to this very day. So how far do we really go?
2:  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.  But the society is so rigged up.
3:  People like that. Don't get awarded.  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.
4:  but Malcolm X  I believe was a very courageous man. He really puts so much of himself on the line for the black community and people like that are always under appreciated.
5:  You will find out in 2020.  but Malcolm X
6:  That was going on in the country then as well as now.  So I'm going to go ahead and play this audio so you can hear exactly what Malcolm X was saying about bringing the u.s. To the United Nations.
7:  just listening to Malcolm X that tells me nothing in America has changed and it's not going to change these people have etched this government in stone and how they wanted to run it and they are carrying it out to this very day. If you are white many things are going to be done for you up in here. You already have a ton of  All kinds of perks.
8:  to go out here and do whatever the fuck they want to us, but I would say there are plenty of races in Congress and in the Senate even today because they sure don't show no results to us whenever we have needs and demands so  just listening to Malcolm X that tells me nothing in America has changed and it's not going to change these people have etched this government in stone and how they wanted to run it and they are carrying it out to this very day. If you are white many things are going to be done for you up in here. You already have a ton of
9:  Ask me in confidence. Like I'll just you know, I'm a grown-ass woman. I'm still going to make up my own opinion like my own mind about you. But if you show me that you are like this and let's be clear. I've only heard those things with Diandra but with Maurice Malcolm talk shit about her Nelson talk shit about her. Both of your exes don't have anything positive to say, they say that you're thirsty. You're a cloud chaser you do anything and then this is what you think. It's taken it too far by like talking about sheet about like her vagina her. No because I  I don't care about her pussy Adam. Like I don't like really did because you talked about no, I did I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did I brought it up because I basically was just like Malcolm is playing the pins which that was the problem throughout the whole season, like before they came in which I know Dee Dee came in day two, but day one you said this is this this batter whatever and a lot of people didn't understand why I was bothered it wasn't that I was bothered by DD being there. I was more bothered with Malcolm because I'm just like, okay you talk shit about her.
 
Topic 56 gaslighting: On Twitter I saw someone reference a podcast interview with a doctor about gaslighting within organizational systems and I would like to hear it.
0:  What I'm talking about today is not gaslighting in the conscious manipulative sense. But again, the effect can be similar to the impact gaslighting has on eroding Trust.

1:  Jay called gas light which was about a woman whose husband slowly manipulates her into believing that she's going insane. I've never seen the movie, but it's on my must see someday list.  What I'm talking about today is not gaslighting in the conscious manipulative sense. But again, the effect can be similar to the impact gaslighting has on eroding Trust.
2:  In a way we can describe it as gaslighting with positive intentions. They learn to question their own reality and in turn to mistrust themselves, it erodes their self-esteem. I know that's kind of hard to hear just sit with that for a second. We've most likely all done it in one way or another.  Many adults have learned to do this from their own experiences with this as children when their parents.
3:  Now lying is often intentional and the distinction here is that this is generally not conscious or with the intent to deceive yet. It can have a similar impact on eroding Trust.  You've probably heard the term gaslighting by now because that's another buzzword thats everywhere of late gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where the manipulator is trying to cause the other person to question their own reality or their memory or their perceptions. The term comes from the 1944 American Psychological Thriller film adapted from Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play.

5:  Look I get it. Our instinct is to protect our kids to Shield them from pain or negative emotions and the reality of the difficulties in life, but inadvertently and out of Good Intentions what this does is teach our kids to mistrust themselves.  In a way we can describe it as gaslighting with positive intentions. They learn to question their own reality and in turn to mistrust themselves, it erodes their self-esteem. I know that's kind of hard to hear just sit with that for a second. We've most likely all done it in one way or another.
6:  These are examples of being congruent you are.  Acknowledging that the other person has picked up on something and instead of denying their reality. You're acknowledging it and setting a boundary for yourself right denying their reality and saying you're fine when you're not fine is akin to gaslighting.
7:  Acknowledging that the other person has picked up on something and instead of denying their reality. You're acknowledging it and setting a boundary for yourself right denying their reality and saying you're fine when you're not fine is akin to gaslighting.  The example I use in my office to drive this home is connected to the story. I shared at the beginning of this episode about my daughter.
8:  Whenever she would find all these pieces it got me like okay, I gotta beat her. My competitive side came out and all that. Yeah, but speaking of competitiveness. We are the number two podcast in the world that I was like, he's like, who should we interview next on the podcast? I was like, duh the number do podcasts. Who else would you interview as the number one button see that that you're talking about the money.  Did last night the Tweety the when you said that earlier, I think I just said he was like he was like I said, I don't really know how to tweet about I used to have a Twitter and I had the best Twitter to handle and the whole world. I thought it was great. And it's I'm the Twitter twitter.com. This is right when it came out and I just thought I just was like chuckling. I'm depressed. I'm so so clever and funny, right? I just thought I was the best little name literally never used it. So now much water is the southern the southern
9:  It it's a dumpster fire. It's total chaos, not like this is going to be any better. So I'm really pumped about doing this but I'm super apprehensive because I've never done this before so I don't I don't really know what I was doing and I'm trying to get like a scope of reference. Right? Like I don't really listen to a lot of podcast. I don't I've listened to like the Josh and Detroit podcast because I mean, I know this is going to sound like a  Thing to say, but I was on it. So kind of Drew me to it. And so I saw what he was doing and I listen to Matt in Vancouver's podcasts at the belligerent Canuck or belligerent Canadian believe. Yeah, the belligerent Canadian podcast really good stuff and I wanted to do it different. You know, like I wanted kind of do my own thing. And so the more I started to research podcast I realized that there is no doing a different man like your
 
Topic 57 nefertiti: I want to hear a podcast I know about that is about Nefertiti.
0:  Became the queen it seems that someone would have written it down. So if Nefertiti isn't the younger lady then who is she or for the sake of this podcast? Where is she even if she's not Tutankhamun's mother the secret to her tomb may be tied to him. Our next theory is one that only came up in the last 10 years. It states that Nefertiti is in KV 62 the tumor.  Common was discovered in a hidden room. But if Nefertiti wasn't actually Tutankhamun's mother then why would she be buried with him and not with Akhenaten in KV? 55? Well, you know the feeling when your neighbor has a nicer to me than yours and you think you might want it for yourself. It might have something to do with that. You likely don't need us to tell you that Tutankhamun is the single most famous mummy ever to be discovered in the remnants of ancient.
1:  Nefertiti's likeness occupies Museum gift shops the world over and the queen herself has become one of the most well-known historical Egyptians rivaled and fame only by King Tutankhamun himself and yet for over a hundred years archaeologists have failed to identify Nefertiti's remains. Where is Nefertiti is her tomb truly hidden, or have we found?  Found her and just don't know it.
2:  As we've said Nefertiti is an extremely likely candidate for never never wotton given that Nefertiti is known to have changed her name to never-never wotton Nefertiti during her husband's rain, but the connection between these two can't be confirmed without a body and never never wattens body has never been found the main piece of evidence that links Nefertiti and the short-lived female.  Rho is the co-regency Stella which features a likeness of Nefertiti Nefertiti's name was replaced with the name on Kappa Rory. Never never Watson. This would fall in line with the theory that Akhenaten promoted Nefertiti to the position of co-regent and that Nefertiti changed her official title. After that Ascension after Akhenaten died Nefertiti continued to rule for a short time until
3:  Out the possibility that Nefertiti is buried in King Tut's tomb.  This brings us to our final Theory like the theory of the younger lady this final hypothesis states that Nefertiti's body has already been found. We just don't know it yet. The theory goes that's mancari the mysterious mummy who may or may not have served as a fair offer short time may actually be never never wotton and if Nefertiti is never never whatin thence mancari,
4:  Eames in Egyptian Royal culture as inbreeding among royal family members was common Queens who were sister or cousin to their kings would often change their name to somehow reference this fact yet Nefertiti never held a name or title indicating that she was a King's sister or a King's Daughter. Nefertiti's official parentage is not known which is strange for if she had been a daughter of King amenhotep the third who later  Became the queen it seems that someone would have written it down. So if Nefertiti isn't the younger lady then who is she or for the sake of this podcast? Where is she even if she's not Tutankhamun's mother the secret to her tomb may be tied to him. Our next theory is one that only came up in the last 10 years. It states that Nefertiti is in KV 62 the tumor.
5:  Period between the death of Akhenaten and the crowning of his son Tutankhamun DNA testing has confirmed that Tutankhamun is the son of Akhenaten. However, the possibility that Tutankhamun is also the son of Nefertiti is unconfirmed and a subject of debate among egyptology suggests the Pharaoh we know for sure that serve between Akhenaten and Tutankhamun is never neferu Watson. And yes  That is the same name that Nefertiti changed hers to in accordance with the new Religion. She started with her husband. However, given that neither Nefertiti nor never neferu wattens mummy has been found. It is impossible to confirm for sure whether they were the same person.
6:  Rho is the co-regency Stella which features a likeness of Nefertiti Nefertiti's name was replaced with the name on Kappa Rory. Never never Watson. This would fall in line with the theory that Akhenaten promoted Nefertiti to the position of co-regent and that Nefertiti changed her official title. After that Ascension after Akhenaten died Nefertiti continued to rule for a short time until  she either died naturally or was usurped by Tutankhamun as we said never never wotton is the likely pharaoh who served in the period between 13:34 and 1332 BC, but there may have been another Pharaoh in that same period the existence of Sin Cara was first noted in the 19th century when their name was mentioned in the discovered tomb of Marie re II who was a superintendent to Queen Nefertiti?
7:  If she had already been promoted by her husband the theory that Nefertiti served as akhenaten's co-regent is supported mainly by the Korean see Stella a fragmented lime Stone tablet depicting Akhenaten and Nefertiti who is designated as his co-regent at some point during akhenaten's Reign. Nefertiti's name was scratched off the Stella and replaced with the name on Kapoor a never neferu Watson.  This could have been due to Nefertiti changing her name further in accordance with her new title or if the entrepreneur a nephron ever wotton was not actually the same Nefertiti. It could have indicated that the queen fell out of favor with the King and was replaced.
8:  That is the same name that Nefertiti changed hers to in accordance with the new Religion. She started with her husband. However, given that neither Nefertiti nor never neferu wattens mummy has been found. It is impossible to confirm for sure whether they were the same person.  There is also a belief that another ferro-cement car a ruled for a short time immediately after akhenaten's death and before never never Watson, very little is known about some in car a we don't know what his or her relationship was to Akhenaten. We don't know much about their rule. We don't even know if they were a man or a woman what we do know though. Is that King Tutankhamun ascended to the throne around 13?
9:  This brings us to our final Theory like the theory of the younger lady this final hypothesis states that Nefertiti's body has already been found. We just don't know it yet. The theory goes that's mancari the mysterious mummy who may or may not have served as a fair offer short time may actually be never never wotton and if Nefertiti is never never whatin thence mancari,  Is actually Nefertiti the nature of this mystery with the thousands of years between when these events actually happened and the present when we're still trying to find answers means that we deal with a lot of ifs and uncertainties when trying to determine what is true or not before we start there are a few assumptions. We need to make in order to qualify this final Theory. We can surmise these based on the facts we know
 
Topic 58 sam bush interview: A bluegrass magazine I read mentioned a podcast interview with Sam Bush.  I’d like to hear it.
0:  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.  Really does sound like you both. It was really the sort of like almost instant creative coming together and weird ways I happen to be for is that like was that unusual? So it's I mean, I'm done one moving of them one television show outside of this. So my experience is limited, but the fact that she and I hit it off so quickly so early is practically unheard of I mean, the first thing we do is like oh, yeah, we all know each other's names.
1:  It's Series on Amazon homecoming starring Julia Roberts, which was nominated for three Golden Globe awards. Although it didn't win any of them. Now people familiar with me or gimlet the company. I co-founded which makes this podcast that you're listening to right now and many others you might remember homecoming began its life as a gimlet podcast and gimlet was very involved in the making of that show. In fact, I did a whole series of Stories on turning the homecoming podcast into the homecoming TV show.  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.
2: You're listening to the we take full responsibility podcast where the games are made up and the points don't matter. No. This is a podcast and with the hard conversations. We need to have in the workplace at home and our communities and with ourselves. We share stories from an interview those on the front lines to help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of effective leadership all with the purpose of helping you the listener. Find health and greater impact wherever you're at. This is Kyle Timothy bush with Taylor homes, and we take full responsibility.
3:  three hours might be two and a half hours. It might be an hour. But rarely, will you hear Sam Harris or Joe Rogan? Say Okay hours up our time limit sup, I mean, they just let it go until it organically dies. And I think that's the way that that a podcast is meant to be. So no time limit again. I'm not a fan of that.  Also in this is one that's that's I don't want to say controversial but you know different people have different viewpoints. We are not going to edit the podcast we will not edit. So if we're live with a QA or we have an interview, we're just going to keep going to examples there so Sam Harris he edits his podcast and and he, you know allows his guests to go back and redact and we'll wait a second, you know, let me edit that out and so on and so forth.
4:  It's called it was cold. We just had like McDonald's and like everyone else is having a smoke and I'm just there and I just want like, oh can I jump in the bushes like a shawl and I just jumped in a bush and it made like a whole like was like, what's this guy with the suit? You knew him or yeah. Yeah, Nathan. Oh, okay. I was gonna say if it's a random guys soon. I know why do you need permission to jump into a bush. Can I help you? Get us McDonalds? Oh the cops came as well, but they didn't we should get in trouble. They went like there was just getting like fucking like it.  Why'd you why'd you help into Mac? Why do you hop into a bush and I dived in a hole in the bushes? Well that I didn't make what a hole in in matters that stupid. I kind of giant except not exactly legit not so go through vagina, but just not losing your virginity. No, it's not what you on about going to is that like a mean that know the name is are you okay?
5:  Are we don't tend to agree? Well, when I went to see her show at Shepherds Bush Empire. It was like untenable e hysterical like how old was the average audience member like one? I'm joking, but like young like so yeah as in parents were taking their chilled as an it was me and the parents and then like children on their shoulder like on the dad's shoulders really I and you couldn't hear Billy before because they just knew every word and they were screaming it but  Nice, I mean Billy. I really want to see her alive, but I just thought she put she said before she performs like a fan. Okay, so she jumps around loose a bit like Travis Scott thing as well. You know, I mean, yeah, I know what you mean, but I do feel sorry for her because she has had quite a like a tough time with like realizing which friends you could try she said recently in an interview that like she used to be so popular and you have so many friends and over the last year. She's lost like almost all of her friends because they are going to use her name in the
6:  No, it was I told him to come with yeah, I know no but like so like what happened yesterday. So like my carer had to look for my other kid that I live with which is called a coat and and then what happened we went to Macker and I put on like this whole like this guy is like ski suit because he came back from like New Zealand and then like I jumped like in the bush what why a book like it's like, yeah, I know but like I fall on just went like jumped off shop like cold.  It's called it was cold. We just had like McDonald's and like everyone else is having a smoke and I'm just there and I just want like, oh can I jump in the bushes like a shawl and I just jumped in a bush and it made like a whole like was like, what's this guy with the suit? You knew him or yeah. Yeah, Nathan. Oh, okay. I was gonna say if it's a random guys soon. I know why do you need permission to jump into a bush. Can I help you? Get us McDonalds? Oh the cops came as well, but they didn't we should get in trouble. They went like there was just getting like fucking like it.
7:  So for its tiny colorful houses as the Bush family grew however, they needed more space. So they moved to a larger home on a high o Avenue in 1951 Georgie as he was often called was only five years old at the time today bushes. Childhood home is listed on the national register of historic places and is open to the public six days a week, but he enjoyed an idyllic baby boomer childhood growing up in West Texas the neighborhood. It was safe. It was full of young families. He played baseball idolizing.  Great, Willie Mays and developed friendships that remained throughout his entire life the Sam Houston Elementary School was not far from his house in 1953 though tragedy struck the Bush family when three-year-old Pauline Robin was diagnosed with a strange disease. Neither Barbara or George senior had heard of before and that disease was leukemia despite their best efforts taking her far from home for treatment in New York Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Robin died. Just seven months after Her diagnosis George Jr. Was
8:  Was there some sort of incremental sort of progress being made in your mind or was it still like it was it just no no, no. No, these were graveyard shifts. So when I was in reality I went I was going in at 6 p.m. And I'm working till 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. This was a grind this wasn't anything this was not learning learning process. This is purely just to pay the rent the grand continued for several years and then Sam got what you could call look.  That in exactly the right light his first break something just a little bit better a small step up. This was in the mid 2000s and DVD box sets were Big Sam's job was to help edit the extra content that went into these DVD boxsets things like interviews with directors and filmmakers about the making of classic movies and after editing those interviews for a while. He got pretty good at it. Well end up happening was I became so good at my job that they ended up making me the post production supervisor, so I had to
9:  Sometimes they ask you some extra questions, you know, like why would you be good working for our company? But I think they can save those questions for the interview, you know, because if you feel CV doesn't have the experience that they need or you don't have the education that they want then they won't call you for the interview anyway, so they're just wasting our time asking you those questions at that point. So yeah, I much prefer when you can just send your CV to people see eyes.  Online some people some people like to use, you know, kind of magazines they have these kind of monthly magazines or maybe newspapers that have have a lot of advertisements or ads for jobs, but those usually because they don't come out, you know, the internet it instant, you know, as soon as somebody puts their ad on the internet boom, you can read it. So I prefer the internet is much faster if you get those magazines, maybe they also put it on the
