1:  He said there had never been a president who had been as transparent Chris Butler reports from Washington in a phone call in July. Donald Trump did ask the Ukrainian president to start an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. He claims that a rough transcript of the discussion choose. There was no pressure put on volodymyr zelanski Democrats. No want full details of an earlier call between the presidents from April to be published allegations that the president misused his position by threatening to withhold hundreds of  millions of dollars of aid
2:  I don't like those guys. Those guys are my boys, but I cannot believe we have this Darth Vader guy in the fucking white house. When I say Darth Vader, I'm not saying I'm against him or I'm for him. But you have to admit we got a guy that's living in the 80s being the president in this fucking thing. You know what I mean? He's talking to the Ukrainian president. I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened.

3:  so he's going after Biden. So he's basically telling the Ukrainian president. You'll give me shit on bite in and if you give me shit on bite and I'll give you fucking money. So that's like some fugged out gangster shit. You can't do that. Right? So the difference between the molar report which was going on for the last three or four years when they're trying to take him down and the difference between this is they actually got a taped conversation or they got some some messages. So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.

You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos? What the fuck's going on that damn, right? I don't want to see that. So he's trying to get dirt on Joe Biden because in Donald Trump sighs Joe Biden is the only one that he thinks kid what the beat him can beat him. Yeah, you know that the angle is he's not trying to get dirt on Elizabeth Warren, right? He thinks Bernie Sanders is fucking gone. He just thinks
5:  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.

7:  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people  Idiots, I had to look at things differently. You will come this November when you're voted out because she was actually one of them that turn that seat. I don't think it's going to go. She ain't going to win this next one day and I think the Democrats lose the house they swore in Chief Justice John Roberts and 99 of the 100 Senators who will serve as jurors were sworn in what happened to the other Senator, huh?
8:  Didn't ever Morales looking exposed and weakened. He can no longer rely on the police to protect him control the street protests after forces in three cities joined calls for his resignation his main rival Carlos Messer has rejected an offer of dialogue insisting on new elections and his resignation. Bolivia's armed forces have said they will never go against the people and the crisis must be sold by Democratic means with all sides in the conflict in Bolivia deadlocked it's hard.  See, however Morales can resolve the situation a day after being freed from prison the former left-wing Brazilian president Luiz inacio Lula da Silva has made a trench and attack on the right wing incumbent.

9:  This to where it is today if Hunter didn't freaking get a job off his daddy and get millions of dollars. Maybe he wouldn't have made to ask to be investigated Dingle explain that supporting impeachment was necessary despite the potential repercussions. Yeah, you're going to lose your seat in Michigan because Trump is not above the law. Neither is Joe Biden hundred Biden and delete 30,000 emails Hillary Clinton and that there was a credible case that the  the events surrounding the phone call with Ukrainian president bailed the mirror solinsky was serious origin and a danger to National Security. So you're telling me that the president of the United States cannot which is his constitutional duty to weed out corruption to make sure the taxpayers money is being spent correctly on foreign aid just because it's somebody that's running for office. They can't do it. They can't ask about it you freaking people
 
Topic 10 boeing 737 crash causes: The Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliner was grounded worldwide after hundreds of people died in two crashes in 2019.  What were people saying about the airline and the company?  What were speculated causes of the crash?  What did people think the effect would be on Boeing’s reputation?  News is relevant, but so is speculation.
0:  He may run out people to fight eventually. They may be a the Amana have to fight the area next time it was shot for the rest of the franchise. I think it meant fide already final finale it meant six the final final finale and it meant seven confirmed by stop final and you cannot find it anymore finale then after that. I maybe we'll get a hit man precursor it boy the birth of it men from it boy to eat man Jane you do under international news the similarities between  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight. Apparently the FAA was so underfunded. They started to let Boeing certify their own brains. Well away own self check on self Syria, of course Boeing will pass their own airplanes are especially if you can tell your customers a our new 737 Max aircraft ever known only as
1:  In the crash of lion and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft have shine a spotlight on America's Federal Aviation Administration FAA and their lack of oversight. Apparently the FAA was so underfunded. They started to let Boeing certify their own brains. Well away own self check on self Syria, of course Boeing will pass their own airplanes are especially if you can tell your customers a our new 737 Max aircraft ever known only as  the simulator training one save money on training by our new planes just one hour on the iPad for each pilot. I will do and because we are bowing I declare it's not a new aircraft just a variant of the old one. I'm not even making the iPad training part a blur. I wish I was it's not even 1 hour is 56 minutes training on an iPad in reality a the 737 Max her is new in many ways. And also now allegedly flawed tragically flawed.
2:  Active and really I'm not there yet. So for me, it's expensive. I don't like it. I never really liked it. And I'm not ready to go in right even though surprising how well the managed to bounce back turnaround was was yeah, it was incredible. But still I'm not there. All right. So while moving on to Wednesday ahead of the opening bell Boeing Clemmie, what do you think? So Boeing my thoughts have been the same over the past few months, even though you know with the crashes and everything as long as there are two plain manufacturers in the world and the US government supports boring. I'm okay with Boeing. Yeah with the well  This report specifically I care I care less about their earnings. And the revenue. I'm I want to hear what management has to say regarding the timeline or for any, you know, when we might see the 737 Max plane back in back in action pretty much also reporting ahead of the opening bell caterpillar. Let me just give my quick thought here on caterpillar a Bellwether of the global economy what it says pretty much will have a direct impact on it can be a big Market mover and if
3:  Is when the Titanic after the crash way after the crash. Yeah, the Olympic crashing 11. It definitely was in repairs because I was on the crash happened, but it goes back in March, okay.  And there was a bunch of shit going on with you Olympic, you know, you know that change it real fast. Yeah, just add a cafe use you break down walls my dad built a wall in my house. That's insane people. Can I think we underestimate what people can do I think that's true. But I also think it's probably pretty hard. Once you have like designed to ship to theoretically be like water tight and this and that and this and that to just go in there and add a whole new Cafe. They're gonna sink. It didn't mean that watertight.
4:  Really going to be something that people want to fly on or that Airlines will want to use I think airlines are may be smart enough or maybe just careless enough or whatever to say. Like, wow, it's good enough for us. But if they know that passengers aren't going to like it then they might just not use it and and even some have been wondering you know, Boeing has another one. I think it's the 777x longer range obviously larger.  That may have some of the same design flaws and maybe that's a story to follow in the future. But anyways, so there's this problem here with with the obviously Boeing and how that plays into the economy and whatnot. But the other thing that I found just fascinating so recently Boeing basically asked for about ten billion dollars in a loan, right and that adds to a pretty large amount of liabilities already, which I'll go over here in a second in addition to a nine point five billion dollar line of credit in October.
5:  Second half of the Year. All right now Tuesday after the clothes snap go snap. Well snap has rallied a hundred seventy percent though this year for me. That might be a good a good time for maybe take some profits all pretty profits off the table don't really want to play going into earnings. But I am a curious to see any figures that has to do with advertising and user base saw growth. All right, so I think holding snap at the valuation right now. It's expensive is giving the benefit of the doubt to the founders and to the  Active and really I'm not there yet. So for me, it's expensive. I don't like it. I never really liked it. And I'm not ready to go in right even though surprising how well the managed to bounce back turnaround was was yeah, it was incredible. But still I'm not there. All right. So while moving on to Wednesday ahead of the opening bell Boeing Clemmie, what do you think? So Boeing my thoughts have been the same over the past few months, even though you know with the crashes and everything as long as there are two plain manufacturers in the world and the US government supports boring. I'm okay with Boeing. Yeah with the well
6:  Day and with the same pilot. She posted on her Instagram stories rest in peace and prayer to these families. I still can't believe this that was the helicopter. I would fly on from time to time with that pilot ARA. He was such a nice man while the cause of the crash is still under investigation Witnesses say they heard the engine sputtering leading to the possibility of mechanical failure. The NTSB is currently investigating what went wrong and it could be a couple of months before findings are released as Kylie.  Chain, we all need to hold our loved ones closer today the world stopped on Sunday. When we learn that we lost the legendary basketball player Kobe Bryant and his 13 year old daughter Gigi and seven other victims in a tragic helicopter crash support started to pour in from fans and celebrities. But Kanye West decided to do things a little different Yeezy held a midnight Sunday service here in La following the news of the laws of the late great Kobe and attendance was Chance the Rapper and Kirk Franklin Kim took.
7:  Since it's become more and more apparent that hey, this is a these were not flukes. This was not just a coincidence that two of them crashed in a relatively short time period but rather there were some major design flaws that Boeing very well may have been knowledgeable of that. They knew that this was a crappy airplane and that scared a lot of people and and you know at this point, it's the 737 Max is grounded. It's not fine. In fact  And so far as to that Boeing is shutting down production of the 737 Max, you know in this is, you know, economically speaking a huge company here in the United States and and the you know, if this continues I mean it's going to legitimately cut into economic growth. We're talking to a few basis points or whatever few tens of basis points a camera of his Kudlow or something else that was recently talking about that and it's obviously not going to be better. I mean Boeing tries to put a
8:  I don't know. That's where we're at today. It's just a question of when will this be escalated further get now? There's also the question of this airliner that was shot down in a neuron following are actually sort of during all these things going on last night. It was a civilian airliner Ukraine International Airlines or something along those lines. And if I remember correctly it was inbound for Ukraine we  This shot down the official story from Iran which thus far cannot be verified by anyone was that it had mechanical failures and crash. But of course such high mean is peculiar. I mean, it's it would be quite The Coincidence, of course a hundred eighty people lost their lives. So you have to ask you know, what? What was the meaning behind us? I don't think it would be a neurons best interest to say that this was some form of Revenge and I don't know. I don't know. I mean there's a lot of Canadians on the board. I mean, I guess you could say Ukraine is a bit of it.
9:  The crazy twin lived. Yeah someday we'll get to that one. Oh my God, never fucking ends. All right. Well, that's a big. Okay will so you're saying they're gonna but how do they make the ship that sank match the ship that everybody knew to be the newer updated one? Oh, no, you do that. Like I don't that's how it goes in for repairs. Okay, and I think was March 1912, and it's April 1912.  Is when the Titanic after the crash way after the crash. Yeah, the Olympic crashing 11. It definitely was in repairs because I was on the crash happened, but it goes back in March, okay.

Topic 12 imran khan career: Imran Khan is the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, and had a career as an international cricket star.  What have people said about his career and achievements?
0:  Prime Minister of Pakistan like about the 1992 World Cups just dinner right? He's unlocked some doors. He's full value on Twitter though. Like I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but he he's not afraid slate opinion most recently about Shahid Afridi decision to the band his daughters from playing Cricket. Yeah, that's quite a lot of trolling or shared freely going on there. That's an area we  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.
1:  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in
2:  Those steps my senses that Masood Azhar may be treated with the same kind of indulgence. But Pakistan would have to demonstrate its own quote unquote good faith in relation to the financial action task force. So while it would be desirable to have a country like Pakistan supporting this kind of an Endeavor in a very very sincere way. The reality is that Pakistan's own internal patterns preferences choices both political and otherwise are inhibiting meaningful cooperation because they are also aware that  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.
3:  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.  Um, so that's a little bit of the back story of the great creaking nation of Pakistan. I think you are everyone should be Brewing Pakistan. It would make their day if they want the bulk up. Yeah, there's not being international cricket played there for a number of years because security reasons, they finally get back to that position where actually the safety in their main cities is good. Yep, and they want people to come back and play like it's huge thing is over. I love Pakistani. Yeah. I mean I think offering them they're my favorite team in the tournament as do you say
4:  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.  In being part of the global Endeavor, we will have a situation where they could be more like a horse you were talking about a small D's reports are not very encouraging. It's apparently one of the nation's from where large number of people have gone and join the Islamic State their comeback. Now these attacks in Sri Lanka you're referring to reports in the media elsewhere about how there is an interconnected or there are some traces of connection. So to say between India and these people who have carried out these strikes now once you know, I make an ism like this comes
5:  Of the great spells of bowling. I mean India or otherwise, I mean Malcolm Marshall how it doesn't get better than that, right? Who wants to go next? Visit Vijay? Yes it hello everyone. This is Vijay are moving from Sydney. I'm going to pick Roger Binny from 1987 the second test match between India and Pakistan. So Imran Khan's Pakistan visited India for a five test series against couple days Indians. This was before  The Reliance cup so this happened in the January February timeframe of 1987 after the high scoring draw in the first test match and Madras 1987 the Caravan moved to Eden Gardens Calcutta back, then it was Calcutta still and Sunil gavaskar refused to play at the Eden Gardens citing the crowd trouble that happened in the 8485 test match against England and Imran Khan having won the toss put India in thinking. Okay. There is no Galveston. Let me get some early wickets.
6:  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in  And your you can hear a pin drop in that Pakistan dressing room. Nobody's talking to anybody. They all looking at their feet. All the players in one corner is Imran. And he said Sonny talks briefly to me and then he looks up and so this team from Pakistan was supposed to take the flight out that evening that night come to Bombay.
7:  Which descended on the Gaddafi that moment when the last you know, when the match was decided is something that takes me back and it was like Gloom had descended and I feared okay. I have no idea what might happen next. Yeah, people might you know, start a riot out of sheer disappointment within a few minutes wailing started people started crying specially the Jannah section where the women were sitting they couldn't believe it at all and I was in a very in a sense a privileged position.  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.
8:  Using bit of a natural element he was able to reduce Pakistan to very manageable first Innings total that helped India to set it up in terms of the game. Unfortunately, India couldn't finish the game off and Pakistan happened to save that game despite being getting another two wickets. So in that particular spell I'm talking about it took six 456 including four four nine four four nine against a very powerful batting lineup in Indian conditions has to be applauded because he wasn't  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India.

9:  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India. So in that perspective Benny spell was a really important one to help India to get some psychological advantage of a Pakistan against a very  be strong batting lineup and also another interesting thing. I don't know if that played any part be a ten-year-old. I heard the word smog the first time in my life are Morgan the famous journalist who covered the game for the Hindu in the sport star, he wrote in that particular weekly saying the smoke cleared and the brief started coming from the hooghly and the calculations are filled up the stands with 70,000 people and the Metro was serving the city like London and Paris and Roger Binny put on a royal show here.

Shame guilt and has strategies for them that our bespoke and evidence-based whether or not they know it or not are evidence based and community and connection and spirituality like these there are a wealth of personal development resources sitting for free in the recovery community and the thought that people who are in recovery would be
6:  Diction or homelessness or you know, like you said a dual diagnosis of several things. It can be very easy to say. I'm okay. I have a roof over my head. I have a job. I have a but this space for both the space space for you to be healthy and look after yourself as well as space for you to help that person but you have to help yourself as well. Otherwise, you can't you can't do either so you can't continue to do it long term. Yeah, which yeah, which is my main.

They're stuck in their situation and  Chronic, that is chronic. I mean it is chronic there. There's a lot of things chemically in the brain that happened and this is part of my education. So along with this. I also went to school to become a drug and alcohol addiction counselor. So they really get some like empirical evidence behind what I think I want to do and it and luckily in this isn't always the case, but luckily all the information that I was learning in school from textbooks and from case studies and from you know, research was supporting what I wanted to do. Yeah, so

Topic 14 near death experiences: I wonder if people have shared near-death experiences in podcast episodes.  I would like to find and listen to some stories.  I am not interested in the science of near-death experiences.
0:  Had near-death experiences and out of other out-of-body experiences. It definitely intrigues me, but I love I still love exploring spirituality and things like that but through the lens of looking at it less is something we need to take on faith and more is something that who we just haven't quite figured out the scientific tools to measure the sort of experience yet and quantify it and and explain it. So to me, it's just a mystery to be solved not anything that proves that there  Something more it's like of course. There's something more like but I don't think we need to get mystical about it. Yeah, it's just there's so much that's unknown. Yeah, we don't understand Consciousness yet. No and something as deep in Consciousness as a near-death experience or a religious experience. It's like, of course, we don't understand it, but that doesn't make it God that doesn't exactly then. That doesn't make it something you have to take on faith. It makes it something that we get the Joy or burden of figuring out if
1:  ooh for us and what's not and also give ourselves permission to change I wouldn't be here today. If I didn't and I always still give myself permission to change it's hard for me at this point to imagine that I'll believe in something again in a classically spiritual or religious sense, but it could happen say aye yeah have some horrible accent. I have a near-death experience and I am convinced. Yeah. Now I've read a lot of accounts of because that's one of the things that fascinates me are people who  Had near-death experiences and out of other out-of-body experiences. It definitely intrigues me, but I love I still love exploring spirituality and things like that but through the lens of looking at it less is something we need to take on faith and more is something that who we just haven't quite figured out the scientific tools to measure the sort of experience yet and quantify it and and explain it. So to me, it's just a mystery to be solved not anything that proves that there
2:  Something more it's like of course. There's something more like but I don't think we need to get mystical about it. Yeah, it's just there's so much that's unknown. Yeah, we don't understand Consciousness yet. No and something as deep in Consciousness as a near-death experience or a religious experience. It's like, of course, we don't understand it, but that doesn't make it God that doesn't exactly then. That doesn't make it something you have to take on faith. It makes it something that we get the Joy or burden of figuring out if  We want to unfortunately a lot of us want to and I love putting their research do school over. I would definitely go into neuroscience and I'd love to work in the field of neuro theology, which is just yeah the Mind science of faith. I think you should do that. It's a fascinating field. Yeah. Yeah. I love learning about it as a hobbyist. So we set off Mike and I joked that you're famous to me because of
3:  Anat live above let's see. I'll pull it up. I was asked braca braca. He was on the track. He was laying low on the planet BRAC out as a scrapper and after one of his buddies that was also part of the Scrapper Guild like has like a near-death experience cows saves them like using the force that he's been from what I gathered mostly cut off from during this.  Have you gotten to the part where Palpatine Execute Order 66 in the game? Yes, the last mission that all Hall. Yes. That was so good. The last mission that I played was the Illinois machine where you get the split saber. Hmm. What color did you picture your split saber? I believe I picked purple and whoo.
4:  Take is the best. Oh, yeah, it's those are the best because they do their research. And by the time they listen to you. Yes, or by the time they practice something like the way you started practicing it. It better be something that's palpable something that that exists something. That's true. I love the skepticism. Well, yeah, and I literally I went I was like prove it prove it prove it. So I had to go the science route of understanding the body and energy what it's telling me and that was 16 years ago. So a lot of  That was like what are you doing? Right but when you've had moments where you you know, you're not going to let I had three near-death experiences. So, you know, you're at the end you're going to really reach out. Right? And this is what I want to touch on with intuition for your listeners to understand is that I knew deep down inside me something had to change our I wasn't going to continue and I two little kids in tow and I was providing them everything. So I'm like do I just lay down and take I was diligent with my medical teams, and they said Tracy there's nothing more we can do for you. You got to manage.
5:  Revenge of the Sith and we're talking about a Order 66 Survivor Cal cast as played by camera monoghan fantastic performance and he's been laying low on some Planet. I'm trying to find I just went on to his Wikipedia. I'm trying to find or actually no, I'm in the Star Wars dot fandom. He was laying low on what's the planet?  Anat live above let's see. I'll pull it up. I was asked braca braca. He was on the track. He was laying low on the planet BRAC out as a scrapper and after one of his buddies that was also part of the Scrapper Guild like has like a near-death experience cows saves them like using the force that he's been from what I gathered mostly cut off from during this.
6:  That was like what are you doing? Right but when you've had moments where you you know, you're not going to let I had three near-death experiences. So, you know, you're at the end you're going to really reach out. Right? And this is what I want to touch on with intuition for your listeners to understand is that I knew deep down inside me something had to change our I wasn't going to continue and I two little kids in tow and I was providing them everything. So I'm like do I just lay down and take I was diligent with my medical teams, and they said Tracy there's nothing more we can do for you. You got to manage.  You're not going to make it long. Well, okay, I could take that information and I could run with it or I could use my intuition which was the feeling inside that there's something I didn't know and I was like don't tell me Universe Divine God. I don't care what you guys say. It's all bullshit cuz I might say that pretty much to me. It was at that time. Exactly. I know and when I looked and digged it really started the dirty, so I went to science wrote first show. We show me. I studied everything science about the body what was happening in back.
7:  And but because you know, it's just it's just not nice. It has consequences. It makes people angry. It's being dishonest and I feel yucky about myself when I'm dishonest. I don't need any other metaphysical incentive to be a good thing. It makes me feel shitty when I'm not so any good person. That's my own definition of a good person. Like I was saying earlier everyone has good intentions myself included. I guess all we can do to be honest with ourselves about what  ooh for us and what's not and also give ourselves permission to change I wouldn't be here today. If I didn't and I always still give myself permission to change it's hard for me at this point to imagine that I'll believe in something again in a classically spiritual or religious sense, but it could happen say aye yeah have some horrible accent. I have a near-death experience and I am convinced. Yeah. Now I've read a lot of accounts of because that's one of the things that fascinates me are people who
8: Singing experience where women gather for the purpose of deep connection and soul nourishment in my living room environment.

Topic 15 podcast about podcasts: I would like to start a podcast.  What equipment do I need?  What kind of microphone?  What sort of space should I use to record?  What software is most helpful?

It's even Isaac see like that's the he see he seen some yeah, he's seen some some  All right. I have a helpful tip / strategy in in-game or if you are being chased at any time pretty much every building has crates or Ledges on the walls that you can get on top of. So if you are getting chased and run into a building climb on top of such an object and immediately you have an advantage to see the enemy when they don't see you. No one runs into a single story building and looks up try it.
1:  Into and inspirational end-of-the-year message. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?  I need you know, how how do I do this? Because I had no clue. So what I got from my research was that we needed a good set of microphones. They told me that audio is important. They meaning Google and all the YouTube tutorials on podcasting what I got from it was that audio was important considering that a hundred percent of the time you're going to be listening to our voices. So if our voice is all you hear the night,
2:  Never really thought about it that way. Well, I mean when you start in Jungle, you know like oh, yeah, this is cool. This is a great place to start and then like you die in the first night because creepers wandering behind you exploding or 15 minutes later. You're still crawling through the jungle, right? Like I swear that this looks exactly the same as that other Bush I passed it's like so it's Minecraft. It's a really cool area, but it's hard to walk through I guess. So what about you because you've got like a detailed list of stuff for ya.  So I started thinking like tips and tricks and then the first thing that popped into my head this like, who are you gonna give tips and tricks to write because if I if I were to give tips and tricks to you and you start a new map those who don't be silly be completely different than to someone who starts with the game for the first time. Yeah, so I thought you will take it sort of beginners and a more experienced tips and tricks, I guess. Okay, and we already divided it into like what are you gonna do for your first night for your first?
3:  So I started thinking like tips and tricks and then the first thing that popped into my head this like, who are you gonna give tips and tricks to write because if I if I were to give tips and tricks to you and you start a new map those who don't be silly be completely different than to someone who starts with the game for the first time. Yeah, so I thought you will take it sort of beginners and a more experienced tips and tricks, I guess. Okay, and we already divided it into like what are you gonna do for your first night for your first?  Tweak and then what after that so yeah, when you are, you're a beginner like the whole game is new to you obviously, so that's a lot of people are really scared of the first night already and they start playing the game dig a hole. So well, that's one thing to do. I think I think that's that's how a lot of people ended up. That's probably what I did as well. I know I admire the first night and then you're going to be boards for like 10 minutes, right?

Just kidding about that last part. Yeah, so I was born an orphan in 1978 and I moved back home to tell them a key where I fuck up Upper from at the age of six and they're moving.

Topic 16 causes and prevention of wildfires: 2019 saw a large number of wildfires, in Australia, California, and the Amazon.  What were people saying about them?  What caused them?  How could they be prevented?  I am interested in news reports but also speculation, rumor, and unverified information.
0:  There and Martin caused property destruction death and Pally across parts of Europe and created an electrical failure that affected most of France the worst cyclone in French history brought down transmission lines and caused large swaths of the country to be without power for three days repairing. The lines was a grueling and expensive task and generators had to be brought in from as far as Canada to act as interim power sources economic losses were estimated at over 18 billion euros and the new record for the largest power disruption in history was quickly.  Spurred across the Atlantic from Brazil number 5 Taiwan back out of 1999 the evening of July the 29th 1999 began in Taiwan with the blasting of a warning siren over the city of Taipei. This was followed by loss of electricity across the country causing widespread speculation and rumor as to what could have caused such a nationwide power outage speculation ranged from a Chinese Invasion to a nuclear attack but reality was much more mundane a landslide knocked out pylon cables creating a domino effect.

Back to the left millions of people both literally and figuratively in the dark number 4 1998 Auckland power crisis, Auckland New Zealand found itself without power for a staggering five weeks after the four main cables supplying the city with electricity suffered mechanical damage. The cables were repeatedly heated up and cooled down by auckland's unusual January weather the old and poorly maintained cables eventually failed one after the other forcing the city to use backup diesel generators the noise of several hundred diesel.
2:  This shining star from Ireland this weather woman from Ireland was a part of this news news. Anchor blooper reel and this this is she was Ill placed in this Serie this Montage of bloopers because this is not a blooper, but her name is Teresa mannion and you might have heard of her. She was reporting live this. I don't know how many years ago. This is a lot of people have seen this clip according to the numbers on YouTube, but she was reporting live from  Way, which is in Ireland on a storm called storm Desmond for this local news station and it wasn't a blooper as much as it was so much passion. So at the beginning of her news report the part that was in this blooper reel that I watched was the heightened her at her most heightened passion, but so obviously your girl did some research and I was like, I want to see the rest of this news report and just see this Arc and I'm going to play for you.
3:  Check here. I'm pretty sure it's been months. If not, probably over a year. Yeah technical analysis REM fundamental analysis. But basically what I'm talking about is there's kind of two ways people trade on the NASDAQ or whatever one is based on rumors and hearsay and where they think a stock school and wanted to be a star of graphs and reading graphs and for a long time. I've said that football index is purely real world news speculation rumors trading based on that.  But there's been a couple of graphs recently. I've seen that literally just scream that this player has hit. I think it's called support whenever you're actually trading there's gonna be a couple of people who actually trade crypto who have treated her and then this guy's a chump. That's fine. If anyone's there at home open up football and next tape and Josh Sergeant, right and look at his three-month graph. So basically what I'm saying here is for a long time. I thought football index didn't have much of a think it's technical analysis, which is where you look at the graphs. I think fundamentals the one

6:  That Y2K preparation could have upset that balance but Vice news reports that most seem to Heed These Warnings from the government and that there were no substantial spikes in purchasing activity leading up to the New Year. Well, nothing besides the usual spikes from holiday shopping thus a significant part of the dark side of Y2K was the idea that it was a damned. If you do damned if you don't situation do nothing and you risk the  elective glitches from multiple vulnerable systems having a cumulative effect on the economy warn people and you risked a panic that would also destabilise the economy. It seems then that the natural mixed response some people acting and others not was actually ideal. It prevented a glitch Snowball Effect, but also didn't lead to mass panic with all of this in mind. There are still those who are completely skeptical of any of these arguments.
7:  Way, which is in Ireland on a storm called storm Desmond for this local news station and it wasn't a blooper as much as it was so much passion. So at the beginning of her news report the part that was in this blooper reel that I watched was the heightened her at her most heightened passion, but so obviously your girl did some research and I was like, I want to see the rest of this news report and just see this Arc and I'm going to play for you.  For this is the first segment. It's like two minutes long and and it's and it's her initial report on storm Desmond nothing out of the ordinary. But but first of all Irish people have a way with words that is truly beautiful. It's like it's like when you guys think before you talk the fuck is very That's A New Concept for me and a lot of Americans, but I think it's beautiful and it's poetic. And so this is the initial report before shit gets crazy and she you know, anytime anybody reports on a hurricane or a storm. It's just like
8:  Are because I like there is no this has to work it's worked and that's why I'm kind of thinking like for me to get that portfolio from whatever 6K to 15K quick. Should I just go balls to the wall because like it's kind of broaden to my thought process. I've always thought doing actual stocks and shares. There's like two ways of like sort of analyze and graphs. There's like fundamental and there's what is a tactical analysis is it? Yeah, I didn't really get that father. I know thereís different methods. Yeah. Let me just  Check here. I'm pretty sure it's been months. If not, probably over a year. Yeah technical analysis REM fundamental analysis. But basically what I'm talking about is there's kind of two ways people trade on the NASDAQ or whatever one is based on rumors and hearsay and where they think a stock school and wanted to be a star of graphs and reading graphs and for a long time. I've said that football index is purely real world news speculation rumors trading based on that.
9:  Or imagine the inverse people are paid but no one can buy anything because multiple businesses lose their ability to read credit cards or consumers can make purchases but they can't get home because the ticket machine on the city bus is malfunctioning. The greatest threat was the snot from a nuclear warhead malfunctioning, but from the cumulative effect of thousands of small changes to various systems in one day it's there for  Possible that without the diligence of IT workers Y2K could have been much worse, but Ironically in trying to alert the public to the dangers of Y2K experts may have almost caused it Vice news reports that survivalist stockpiling leading up to Y2K actually could have made the economy vulnerable if suddenly everyone stockpiled medicine, for example, then those who needed it the most might not have had access.
 
Topic 17 time between meetings: I am looking for some ideas for things to do during breaks between meetings.  I would like to take advantage of my short (half hour or less) gaps between meetings to refocus my mind or relax.
0:  Here and there but I was like I'll just take this with me. So like I fucking chugged like half of it and then I drink the rest like to get in a Harkins cup and just went to my meeting didn't think anything of it and I hadn't been to these kind of meetings in a while. Like my Wednesday nights are usually really busy with the kids. And so I go to the meeting I drink all my pineapple juice and in the morning, so Thursday morning I wake up and like I guess I lost some of my mucus plug so  Yeah, so I was like, okay, this is different. So I'm like Googling all these things. And of course, there are some things that are like, it could be hours. It could be days. It could be weeks that until you go into labor because the mucus plug is basically like this plug between like you and the baby and it's been keeping her safe up inside me from anything that can get up inside me and then
1:  In it and you're experiencing all parts of it. I just I always think of that with mindfulness, but if it's too hard, so how so you're looking the two things you're looking at is how what's happening the stressor how it's affecting you the result. It's having on you and then what you're projecting as a result of that stress. Yeah, like what you're projecting or even just like  If you were to walk into a meeting like IEP meeting if you're in the school or like caregiver meeting carefully unlike when you walk into the room like how you're feeling and maybe what you make be projecting to them when you walk in, but then also like what is the room sending back to you when you walk in? You know, we'll just see how sending you like. What are we looking at? Like nonverbal language? Are we looking at like eye contact? Like, how are we judging?
2:  Our yes in a perfect world. I don't think that I can't I just I can't do that anymore. I post the phones in my hand for the next half hour. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll answer every post but if I'm if I drop the post right before I hit the highway to work, I'm not going to be on the highway Channel by comments. No, no. No, I'm gonna be probably listening to a podcast or some music and I'll check in with it again in half an hour, but Mark or don't you guys have any little tips and tricks that aren't really secret but what do you do to balance? I'm not going.  Do you like I Rely heavily on you guys? So I mean, I don't know if it's a tip or a trick, but ultimately, you know, you could find a couple of people let's say three or four other people that are within the same level that you're at. So if you have like the same amount of followers and everything that you're with your in your little group and you can balance ideas and things off if you're struggling like I
3:  In my head, I could build up the pictures of kind of what it did and I had all these pictures in the back of my brain from how I'd experienced similar software systems. And so I did a two hour training with a one-on-one training with a customer and I'd never used the software before but by the end of it she goes. Oh, you're so good at this and I was like, yeah. Yeah, I am because I could just get through it like that. That's that's the power of our minds and they're so so powerful and in that meeting I really  seeded and I think one of the challenges we all have is in those meetings our brains rush off we go in different directions. It can be very hard to stay at least be able to stay present. So it's really important, you know, in some meetings like that. It's quite important to look at different things. You can use I use an app called oughta o TT ER AI now if you have a look at that, you can download it. I think there's a free version and what it
4:  If you were to walk into a meeting like IEP meeting if you're in the school or like caregiver meeting carefully unlike when you walk into the room like how you're feeling and maybe what you make be projecting to them when you walk in, but then also like what is the room sending back to you when you walk in? You know, we'll just see how sending you like. What are we looking at? Like nonverbal language? Are we looking at like eye contact? Like, how are we judging?  Other people's. Yeah, nice like so yeah all of that and let me know what's not Flawless because he did there are like like me I always look like if I'm not smiling everyone always tells me I look like I'm really mad and I'm like, no, I'm just thinking like I'm mad now but like constantly my parents used to ask me all the time. Like what's wrong. I was like nothing. I mean now I'm annoyed with you but nothing
5:  you know things happen. So now I'll tell you about my birth story. So last Wednesday after work, I had a leaders meeting for my Buddhist organization and it wasn't until a little bit later. So I got home from work. I was cleaning up and I just like made a little bit of food and I'm like, you know what? Let me just drink this like whole fucking can of pineapple juice right now like it was in the fridge and I was going to have it like  Here and there but I was like I'll just take this with me. So like I fucking chugged like half of it and then I drink the rest like to get in a Harkins cup and just went to my meeting didn't think anything of it and I hadn't been to these kind of meetings in a while. Like my Wednesday nights are usually really busy with the kids. And so I go to the meeting I drink all my pineapple juice and in the morning, so Thursday morning I wake up and like I guess I lost some of my mucus plug so
6:  Other tips include unsubscribing from newsletters that threatened to distract you at all hours of the day turning your email notifications off and keeping your emails short really short. Don't worry about being rude through a brief email being briefed as a sign of respect for the other person's time as well as your own some movement suggest limiting your emails to just five sentences or less. You can always add additional resources to your email for clarification and further explanations.  Chapter 5 say no to meetings. How many times do you leave a meeting thinking? Well, that was a waste of time. It happens and many places have worked him to fall into this trap of scheduling meetings for the sake of touching base and scheduling a meeting. This practice is a hindrance to productivity and research even suggests that more than half of employees find meetings to be complete time-wasters for instance research presented by atlassian suggest that employees attend an average of 62.
7:  There was a closer Walmart Walmart. Like the one big thing to do right now is to go to Walmart. Like even now when I go home and I visit my sister and my mom and brother and stuff like to my little nieces like who wants to go to Walmart. It's like that. It's such a big deal and so much fun because it's one of the only things to do and that's probably from my mom's house maybe a 20-minute drive, but it's three and a half hours. So if you're looking at Massachusetts, it's three and a half hours away from Boston. So it's in if you're looking at Massachusetts, it's in the very upper left hand corner of the state.  So my mother's house is a pretty much five minute walk to Vermont and like a 10-minute walk to New York. Like it's really up in that corner and it's so that you have to drive over this big mountain where you lose cell phone service to get to my hometown. So it's hard for me to get home for that reason. It's a track. It's like a full 14 hour travel day. It's like either I find a Boston and I drive three and a half hours home or Iya, just like should I go to Australia?
8:  I gave so much money and so much hours to it. So that was the main thing I did. Yeah, so I think for me I mostly we'll just toss up. How are you Janet? So I think I've talked about I was in the Ascension dance team, which was like the college really did one and then I also was on a community dance team to 20 hip-hop, which is really good. By the way. I was only on the for one year. But yeah dance is side. I was also really involved in student government. So UCSD unlike the other UCS. It's kind of the format. We had like separate colleges and then also one universe  See wide Student Government. So I was a freshman senator for Ravel and then would have the Revell College meetings and then we'd also have the as a senator you then represent revelle College against all of the other colleges for the student wide government meeting. So that was actually a huge time commitment it meant two nights a week. I was like in meetings for like two to four hours and it involved like planning events, but then also like having to be studied upon or like read through all the emails where people were like proposing different forgot the terminologies for it, but like when they want to pass different
9:  When I'll do it, I'll say what can you tell me this but pretend to be a guy on a chat room. Yeah, that really gets my attention to ask her. But if you say can I because I was like a business meeting. It's like pause. Let's get emotion out of it. I'll be like, okay, like I felt like it hurt my feelings when this happened. Am I where were you coming from with that? And then that'll help that's so like I love that. I might have to use that for future release go for it. So comedians seem I've mentioned some minions. They usually like it like they're like, oh this really good idea.  More like fuck this sociopath kind of yeah, because we've a business me. I mentioned my when I first started my girlfriend I was like, you know, when we if we were feeling when you talk with something like safe space anytime talk about it, which is so we have like a heads-up. Why don't we call a business meeting and she was like or we could just like talk to each other and I was like, right but like we could and then there was there was I remember one time she's not a comedian. No, so there's one time I forget it was like we talked and then like a couple minutes later. She called and said
 
Topic 18 women in stem: I’d like to hear personal stories from women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  I am not interested in initiatives to increase women in STEM, or movements surrounding women in STEM, or news reports about the prevalence of women in STEM.
0:  To like Russia chaotic, but still rules then a CO we hardly had a co-op Ania VC on talk JVC Broadband woman in stem in engineering lab specifically Aku rasa.  Bannakaffalatta women in Engineering in its endearing everybody.
1:  Okay. Did you have a solid any original first button and get all background? Yeah funny in into and technically Mia. So simple fashion designer Tsukasa Kimia physical met Yoda.  To like Russia chaotic, but still rules then a CO we hardly had a co-op Ania VC on talk JVC Broadband woman in stem in engineering lab specifically Aku rasa.
2:  To learn so I think for my role specifically I know that even people who have been doing it for a long time, you know still learn a lot of things everyday. So I think it's just the dynamic of the business and the dynamic of you know, the customers in general. So I think it'll it'll take a while.  It's gonna get a little more in depth about you as a person and what you've been doing with your career specifically so, you know for being a Latina in stem. What are some things that you think are challenges for you and others like you in the stem Fields? Yeah. I think the biggest challenge that I faced as a Latino woman was the huge culture shock in my first
3:  It's gonna get a little more in depth about you as a person and what you've been doing with your career specifically so, you know for being a Latina in stem. What are some things that you think are challenges for you and others like you in the stem Fields? Yeah. I think the biggest challenge that I faced as a Latino woman was the huge culture shock in my first  Chef I think leaving from El Paso to Missouri in and of itself, you know was a huge move, you know, you know for me, you know growing up in El Paso and never really leaving it was you know difficult to leave and even if it was just a couple months of just you know, I was really scared to go. And so when I moved it was, you know shocking to be the only Hispanic, you know in the facility, you know, and you know in this
4:  Politic but young lady, but karma advocacy on Cuba what the real value to Adela empowering women in Engineering in stem area. Then he put encourage upon token biology kaduna engineering  Woman engineer. Are you gonna be sad my daughter wrong up by a bomb from Pony My Little Pony a passion and courage it on top. Yeah coordinate y not it took impact loading in 2030 Indonesia, 4.0 guy. Yeah honky-tonk aquatic industry than be doing engineering than technology Chaparral Gilliam. One thing is sure.
5:  Crown luggy gambling Akuma big International depend on a shebang then you are now listening to that gym socks with Olga Agata called a little more Brilliance Punjab region to the area by just given any funniest  Politic but young lady, but karma advocacy on Cuba what the real value to Adela empowering women in Engineering in stem area. Then he put encourage upon token biology kaduna engineering
6:  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so  You know, it's really fun. I can remember the exact feeling / time. I don't know the exact date when you know, my you know, I when I was a kid like I love random things dinosaur space and I wanted to be like, you know an astronaut paleontology store. However, I'd like geeky stuff it maybe that's a common thing. I like is love science and technology because young and excited when I school so I went to La Salle Jebel.
7:  Well, you know getting to know each other as people you learn, you know to care for them in a different way or you learn to get to know them and see them as a person and you know connect with them and it's very individual way. So I think that's definitely been the biggest challenge, you know, being the only woman in classes sometimes, you know, sometimes you're like, you know eight out of like 70 or something definitely for like Mike Mckenna.  Kle engineering classes and even now, you know, it's not just about stem Fields. It's also in business, you know incorporate in general manufacturing. I think we're always, you know minority and I think now even in meeting sometimes, you know, how time one out of two in a meeting of you know, 20 or you know, just just generally always the minority. So I think it's just learning to to know that you have a spot.
8:  Those feminists are again. We're saying of you strap-ons your again just replicating male violence against women. So Shauna wouldn't be selling any and the other one were like, of course, you can use a strap on its consent. It's pleasure all those kind of things. So then they kind of started separating then of just this side was kind of more sex is all about danger and this side was like it is but it's also about pleasure and other things as well. So it kind of stems from all that as well. And of course if you're only exposure to  LT is true negative terms on so many women have been sexually abused, you know, you throw a stone and hit a woman who's been sexually abused and and you know, we live in a very patriarchal world. We have you know, the me to movement is only touching the surface of all the experiences of women. So when you have really negative porn and violent porn and drawn into that, of course, it's this awful toxic mix. Well then when but when you're told all porn is when you're not going to look, you know,
9:  It's crazy because a lot of Filipino startups look up to you as one of the four founders of what it is right then back in 2011 2012. That's where the real startup movement other prior to that. There were a lot of you know here and there there's companies we call it internet companies but it's really solidified when idea space where was born Kickstart was born it is just steamrolled from there and let's just track back a little bit. So right now you're wearing three three main buckets, let's I mean three main  Let's talk about that but later on but let's start to how did you start this hustle? Where did this love for startups and Technology stem from? Yes. I mean it really depends on how far do you want to go? Right like, you know, you can go far as shins and I was a kid or as far as even in high school, but maybe let's start from there just to be like totally transparent and kind of a fun conversation right and, you know, maybe not a lot of people even though some of this story so

And I think those two combos kind of guided why I got interested in technology so history certainly repeats itself, but you're like, why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? And one of the Pinnacle foundations of how things change is certainly technology? So that's the the History part.

Topic 20 cost of childcare: I’m looking for personal stories from people that have had to deal with increasing childcare costs.  How did they manage?  What was the effect on their lives?  Reports about average increases in childcare costs are not relevant unless they include quotes from individuals about their experiences.
0:  To share these stories, you know my own personal stories, but then other stories from people that I meet along the way whether it's through travels or people I meet at home and become friends with entrepreneurs just people going through different life experiences. Like I had with my hiking experience and Utah anything. I want to share their stories so that everybody else can  Your how getting out of your comfort zone can really and truly help you live life to the fullest life is way too short and we should all feel like we can follow our dreams when you're a little kid teachers are always asking you like what do you want to be when you grow up? What dreams do you have? I feel like
1:  You don't want to think about that. Yeah, and that be and nappies but say there will be a window in a life cycle where you will purchase that product. So for example from the birth of her first child through to the age of the youngest child sort of graduating out of that could be a period of five to ten years that a family will be in the market for that. So at some point that market ages and you've got to replace that market, so I'm sure that there will be some  in Zed people that will have children for example, and that they will become a target market as their life cycle enters in that sort of age range of being appropriate for a certain category because in some categories you fully replace your customers. You don't have them for Life say like maybe a mortgage company or home insurance might have you for decades. Whereas something like baby products or childcare or things like that are very sort of short-term their 5.
2:  People I'll say hey, maybe you shouldn't go zip-lining in Ecuador because bad things can happen, but I wouldn't have known if I didn't do it. And now I'm going to share it with you. It doesn't necessarily need to be so complicated and I feel like everyone makes it a little complicated now. I am really excited because my goal with Kaitlyn Castle Creations is too.

Ten years, but is it is this something that is there any particular brand or markets on the top of your head that has kind of like a tiger Market from start of life to end of my conside banking? Yeah, because that's you know, people need finance and payment and you see the bank's now appealing. I don't know if you've seen the wearable, you know the pay we're so caps and little chips and Rings the Halo ring that you're like a paywave god.
4:  You realize very quick. It's much easier to keep existing customers happy and increasing this lifetime customer value or at least maintaining the average versus constantly trying to go out and get new clients because advertising it can be expensive and I say expensive. I do want to kind of deviate really quick and do another topic. I'm going to mention this  throughout the podcast this idea of advertising cost and it doesn't always necessarily mean just the cost of
5:  We're trying to fit them with what we already know about. And so what I would say is just to remain completely open and curious and respectful and let them tell you their stories. The main point that I wanted to make in this conversation is  I think someone who considers themselves transgender is like fingerprints. Every single experience is an individual experience Note 2 are going to be the same. So you see that individual what's going on with them and what they're looking for in terms of help and support that's a fantastic way to finish because we all are individuals and we just don't go buy a particular.
6:  Cost proof-of-work is the part that looped it all together and helped us for the first time in history associate a real world cost to an ephemeral fungible digital object furthermore because proof-of-work is a compounding phenomenon. It only gets stronger and more immutable with time. This is at the core of why people say quote Bitcoin is antifragile it benefits from the passage of time.  time the Lindy effect
7:  But I remember one of my mentors telling me hey Mike. Listen, if you're going to invest in real estate it cost the same amount of money to get somebody out and check out, you know, it cost the same amount of dollars per hour to get somebody to check out an AC unit at a million-dollar home as it is as a $75,000 duplex, right? It's the same cost per hour. So what I would say is, you know to be in front of somebody who wants to sell their home it cost you the same amount of money to be in front of somebody let's say with this.  The cost of a postage right? It's the same amount of money to get their attention with the postcard because you know, a postcard ten-million-dollar home costs the same as a postcard to 50,000 or home or a hundred thousand road. So for me if it were me I would actually start with the neighborhood in the reason why is because you get to control that that cost to acquire a customer or what that opportunity is meaning if I know that I'm going to spend money and I know the average transaction price and the average what I would be
8: We're here in the middle of the African Savanna on Safari looking for is that a lion stalking us? I think it's something much scarier.  It's a search term report and someone has keywords with a hundred fifty percent a cost. Oh, no never added any negative keywords, and it looks like all their bids are just three dollars no-bid optimization. We're in trouble we need to do something about this giant a cost, but I don't know if I can do it alone. Oh, no the adventure. Should we run? No, no, no.

Topic 21 juneteenth: What does Juneteenth mean to people in the US? How do individuals feel about it, celebrate it, experience it? What are their thoughts and feelings about Juneteenth? Factual explanations of what Juneteenth is are not relevant.
0:  We feel that behind the stream of our thoughts of our feelings and our experiences. There is something which is the Thinker the Feeler and the experiencer.  Not recognizing that that is itself a thought feeling or experience and it belongs within and not outside the changing Panorama of experience.
1:  A fundamental feeling in most of us that we are such Witnesses.  We feel that behind the stream of our thoughts of our feelings and our experiences. There is something which is the Thinker the Feeler and the experiencer.
2:  Not recognizing that that is itself a thought feeling or experience and it belongs within and not outside the changing Panorama of experience.  It's what you call a cue signal.
3:  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we  Use that to answer, you know, it would look at it. I mean you by being an individual you're also a member of the community by just being yourself because you have your own experience that you're bringing to America and then that's not quite clear what I'm trying to say. It's pretty much I think what American literature is
4:  Individuality of many people everybody reading it me the song of myself the song of everybody reading it but it's essentially what we kind of talked about and we know we're in relating this back to Henry David Thoreau talking about you know, how to be your individual and how I raised the question of you know, the individual versus Community. I think that question about the individual is kind of Aunt  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we
5:  I care about your feelings your feelings matter. So it's almost like in the same way of like when you're validating somebody's perspective when you're trying to make them wrong saying.  Your opinion matters to me, you know it again it all depends on our child has rights. Some people have had their experience their thoughts really invalidated. Some have had their feelings. It's just depends on what is our sensitive vulnerability points and so paying attention to what people and so for me, it's yes, it's you I really care about you. It doesn't the details don't matter anymore. I just want you to know that I'm here. I care it's that care. It's like we want to feel like what's when we're hurting.
6:  teach about this but essentially the the energy of the body moves from the root up into the crown and then comes back down again. So you have in the lower three chakras the core of the of of your energy doing a lot of work feeling safe and secure feeling actually feel having those feelings allowing those feelings to process and move up into your body and then having thought around those feelings those of your lower three chakras you root your sacral and yours,  Reflexes now the Heart Center takes all those three and they combines them into one and identifies what it is that you truly desire for yourself based on what you need to feel safe and secure what your feelings are around that your thoughts around those feelings and then ultimately that desire in the heart. So we use this energy in the Heart Center.
7:  Basically a entrenched way or habitual way of perceiving reality through my thoughts through my feelings through my perception that keeps me stuck when I want to manifest Financial abundance as I am older so karma in a sense explains resistance. That's that it's they're very much related. So I like how he says here how people treat you is their karma how you react is yours that basically means that it's all perception. It's your habits of a  Reacting reactivity the way you react is very much related to Karma its habitual basically karma is habit. How habitual is the way you think and feel because your thoughts your feelings your behaviors are ultimately what shape your life. So I really really like that quote. Now the last one and I want to go through this one quick. This one's kind of pretty straightforward. There's not that much to say about it, but I thought it was a really nice quote to end with and it says here you'll see it when you believe it right because
8:  I always pick this for me that really speaks to some hold from a past life and like when it's just a repeating. Yeah, I don't let your like and especially full first of all with this individual.  I just feel like such a like a high level of self-awareness. Yes. Oh, yeah for me that I feel like this individual has lived in many lifetimes because I just for just the fact that like, you know this about yourself that I have this block or I have this tendency to like go after the wrong individual. That's what that's pretty good self-awareness. Yes. That's a that's used being able to step away and look at yourself objectively, which a lot of people who obsess to can't do. It can't do it. They're like in it.
9:  Them anything. It's really important for you guys to understand as well. And for everyone to understand is that no one can ever make you feel anything without your permission, but you also can't make anyone else feel a certain way.  So you are a hundred and ten percent in control of your thoughts feelings and emotions and how you react to certain situations and so is the other person I think that is so important for people to understand is that you have the right to let someone control your emotions, you know, if I mean if you want to then you can I don't see why you like it, but you are a hundred and ten percent in control.
 
Topic 22 chernobyl hbo: The series Chernobyl aired on HBO in 2019.  What were people saying about it in podcasts?  I am especially interested in discussions about how events depicted in the show differed from reality.
0:  I'm unique in this office. I have a much longer commute than most people For Better or Worse most times worse. So I listen to a lot of podcast namely right now. I'm listening to One called critical role. It's a podcast about Dungeons and Dragons. We're a bunch of voice actors play it I listen to a design podcast weekly called 99% visible a comedy podcast called my brother my brother and me. I mean the list goes on and on and on but that's just kind of The Stereotype box that I'm trying to check.  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.
1:  If I guess I just came off finishing the Chernobyl podcast. Oh, yeah, that was like so basically Chernobyl HBO made the show Chernobyl which is absolutely fantastic. But there's an episode by episode podcast with the showrunner that really looks into like not just the making of the episode but how much of the historical like realism they kept intact and just that whole like that whole thing is just absolutely insane and just a really fantastic podcast a fantastic show revisionist history.  Always I'm catching up with season three. That's a really great one. Oh there I mean there's some episodes of the Conan podcast that like have me in tears. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, honestly. Yeah, I don't I don't think that's kind of there. Is this there is this one episode of Thomas middleditch and Schwartz that like killed me and then film spottings kind of a go-to that was like the first podcast I ever started listening to regularly. So awesome. Well, it's read more about Patrick and Kyle's trend of podcast as digital test Labs as well as our other.
2:  I say even a bullshit right is the best BS right? They can just see when something is not real. Yeah. It's like I think that that's the main thing that's going on here. And I think that like, you know, something like a it was a bloody good movie. I watched recently well again, mine hunter bring it back to mine honey. That's a brilliant TV show. It's like that held me for you know, I barely have enough time to make my own videos let alone sit and watching Netflix series and that helped me for Chernobyl. Chernobyl was brilliant those episodes right now and really hearing  So much about it those episodes were who's got it at the moment. Like what network is Netflix and I don't know Netflix don't have it. It's HBO. So I watched them fall still. I wish it on fox tail now so brilliant brilliant. It was each episode is 70 minutes long and I was hooked the room the entire way through. Yeah, but if you make me a five-minute video, that's trash. I'm not going to sit through it at all. No matter how short it is. I could you could make me at 15 second in strange, right because people will binge like Netflix a like 10
3:  I I did a podcast about a week ago in sort of a hurry because I had failed to do one and I was on vacation and I was trying to make up and I'd forgotten about the things that I had listened to or said or done and I even tried to make up last week and talk about some things and I even missed some things then it would until after I'd hit record and all that stuff and published it that suddenly it dawned on me. I was like, oh crap. I forgot to talk about the other stuff.  So anyway, let us talk about it. Shall we I finally got around to watching A Star is Born on HBO. Now it doesn't have to be on HBO. I'm just saying it's on HBO right now. Now this is the third remake of A Star is Born. I had watched it years ago when it was Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. And you know, I remember people saying that they really liked the movie and as a kid, I watched it and it was a little too more it was too grown up for me, but I watched it and even then I thought
4:  So anyway, let us talk about it. Shall we I finally got around to watching A Star is Born on HBO. Now it doesn't have to be on HBO. I'm just saying it's on HBO right now. Now this is the third remake of A Star is Born. I had watched it years ago when it was Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. And you know, I remember people saying that they really liked the movie and as a kid, I watched it and it was a little too more it was too grown up for me, but I watched it and even then I thought  But now watch this one and I was really impressed. I was impressed by Bradley Cooper. I was impressed by Lady Gaga. Of course, it's hard to be impressed by an actual recording artist that they can make music. I mean don't get me wrong. It is sort of like magic. I mean, they're creating something out of nothing there is nothing and then they go huh. That's something I can make something out of that. They may hear court or they may hear a poem in their head that somehow turns into a verse but then they can put it to life and it's like creating an
5:  As I positive that this person wrote this thing as well have to Google it. Yeah, but I think it was very sluggish and so hit him hit him real quick. So the lake house by Kate Martin what Alice Forgot by LeAnn Moriarty and  Oh my work on where the cotton dancing by Dahlia? Yeah Owens so good and I would say that Brooke is definitely more interested in listening to like I don't want a slower-paced books, but I will because I think that's the way I would describe them. Okay, as someone who's kind of stumbled in on you listening to them like more character-driven she wrote big little lies. I knew it which is the HBO show with all those people famous women. They're definitely more character-driven.
6:  Well, that's not saying much. I did hear that Game of Thrones had a very shitty ending.  Well HBO, what the heck? What's up with all these terrible series finale thinking of HBO. I'm watching Barry now. It's fantastic. Sorry. This is so Random was very is so good. Um, okay. So let's wrap up about this and then let's talk about our specials are segments and our news and all of that. But this was this was such a good show. I have so much to say no. I honestly even though the series finale disappointed me I can say I'm very sad to see the show and and
7:  Oh my work on where the cotton dancing by Dahlia? Yeah Owens so good and I would say that Brooke is definitely more interested in listening to like I don't want a slower-paced books, but I will because I think that's the way I would describe them. Okay, as someone who's kind of stumbled in on you listening to them like more character-driven she wrote big little lies. I knew it which is the HBO show with all those people famous women. They're definitely more character-driven.  And like they're all female protagonist, right? Yes. And so if you enjoy that type of thing those three books would be good for you. Yeah. All right, go on the other hand myself. I only complete I confess I live legit and on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I love listening to Fantasy and science fiction books and just like the sort of these epic sagas. Yeah, and once again, I have walked in on and like the area
8:  This is it is. Yeah, I think a lot of times with these limited series or miniseries and all that sort of stuff II wonder if from their perspective as a studio or production company or whatever they were a well if we only do five I feel like we're only going to be relevant for a month or two you could we're going to move on because we're so short no hit hard in five or six episodes and people will talk about time every week stranger things a debauch. It's yeah an episode. She'll talk about Chernobyl every day for the last two weeks. I've heard at least one person tweet.  Talk about or reference Chernobyl. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's we talked about this a lot but more isn't always better exactly know like let's get the quality content out and people will talk. It's just like in and out dude. How often do they like do they you see advertisement or anything like that? It's all Word of Mouth people know about it. And it's you have to kind of Follow that mentality in order for your show to kind of get notice. Yes. It's not about 23 episodes, which I will never ever watch any more think I think I'm gonna do after we're done.
9:  I'm like could be a solid pilot. What's the rest of the exhaust? Yeah, and also it not being on Fox and I'll be on epics is a great. Do you have sort of a more free rein opportunity to do kind of whatever you want. Maybe I could be a bigger budget maybe yeah because because it's a limited series and it doesn't have to do 23 episodes of season, right if you have 810 and it's like great we have more of a self-contained story or not doing villain of the week sort of thing. Yeah, and we can really develop Alfred as a character and also on top of that develop the relationship between him and Thomas Wayne, so whenever  The show concludes by the end of it. You understand why Thomas Wayne felt so connected to Alfred and why Alfred feel so connected to Bruce sure. I think we also have to look at something like Chernobyl which is killing it across all the boards. Have you guys seen it yet, but she first episode guys watch the entire thing. I've seen it and now I have to give it to Chernobyl because they do what's rare in this now and it's only six episodes It's a super tight six.
 
Topic 23 notre dame fire: The 2019 fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris personally affected many people around the world.  I’m looking for episodes of podcasts with people talking about how it affected them, how they felt about it, their personal recollections of visiting Notre Dame or otherwise experiencing Notre Dame in some way.  Factual information about the fire or about the cleaning and reconstruction effort are not relevant.
0:  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.  It was the most magical music and the people who would walk by in the morning would often stop for a moment or two to listen to The Sounds rising out of the Old Stone building not many people noticed. But if you listen closely, you would actually hear more than just the choir singing inside. There is also another noise that rose out of Notre Dame. It was a beautiful sound as well full of humming.
1:  It was a crisp cool morning in the beautiful city of Paris people sip their hot coffees and nibbled on their freshly baked baguettes in the cafes. They walked along narrow roads and over beautiful stone Bridges going to work or simply enjoying the city.  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.
2:  Some other tragic news over the weekend related to Notre Dame is the arrest of land and bartilson the defensive back from Kentucky. That would have been coming in in June. He is not going to be coming to Notre Dame arrested with a couple others.  Stolen vehicle stolen Firearms. I'm not sure what all else is involved, but he will not be playing football for Notre Dame. Yeah, I mean, so it was less than 20 less than 24 hours before Notre Dame was basically cut ties with bartilson. I'm he's the only decision to make and they made it quickly. I guess I'm shocked in some ways that this happened and this singular instance, but also in some way surprised that Notre Dame has not
3:  Not career snaps by the rim Defenders against Navy that are playing in this game. Oh 800 career snaps for Notre Dame's Defenders against this against Navy in this game. That doesn't even include Kyle Hamilton will do a good job. Well and second year the Clark Lee's coordinated against it third year that Clark Lee's been involved in coordinating third against Lee has been involved in coordinating against it for a year because they plan for more than a week. I if someone's going to beat Notre Dame this  I am now convinced it's Navy because it's just a good offense. It's a great offense and a game defense. I'm not going to be too much more than that because I don't play the level Notre Dame enough, but 800 snaps man. They Notre Dame with Clark Lee should be able to hold them to four touchdowns or less and I'm doing 3124 Notre Dame.
4:  C glow about them. Yeah, it's just a bad football team the whole I guess I can't stress enough the people that the bottom half the SEC sucks. And if that's all tournament, it's the bottom half of the other P5 conferences. They'd get skunked. Yeah. Well, I mean the whole SEC narrative is ridiculous. I saw SportsCenter guy after Notre Dame was just blown out by Georgia man. That was such an ass kicking. Oh what a minute Notre Dame was driving to win that thing in lost by 6 that if you didn't take Notre Dame in the points on that, you know,  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the
5: Live I know that there's not much chance of them getting the playoffs but I just did a thing this morning about this would be five years of the last six heading into know which Brian Kelly has remained as had one loss or less going into November. So there's some significance of that guys. What are your thoughts on the line moving the way did well we thought the four and a half was Askew one-and-a-half made sense. And I want one by Notre Dame would have made sense to I you know, this usually late money is dumb.  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.
6:  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the  And after Georgia dismantled Notre Dame, it doesn't it's like you don't even have to watch the game or actually know what happened. You just want to run with your SEC narrative. And when you combine that with Notre Dame sucks and can't play division one team. Well, that's just a happy marriage, right? Unbelievable. Yeah, it's I'm happy to give credit where credit's due but the constant propping up and polishing of an imperfect product. Right really once you get past the Marquis teams, it pisses me off. I'm with you and Notre Dame played.
7:  I am now convinced it's Navy because it's just a good offense. It's a great offense and a game defense. I'm not going to be too much more than that because I don't play the level Notre Dame enough, but 800 snaps man. They Notre Dame with Clark Lee should be able to hold them to four touchdowns or less and I'm doing 3124 Notre Dame.  And if I have to pick against the screen like say the spread 7 that'll be 30 24 Notre Dame. Like I think maybe we'll cover if we're not come trying to do the fake put ourselves into sight because you were you you you didn't you beg that not to let you change your mind a hundred snaps. Okay. All right, so that that's my point. That's what has changed your mind about that. These guys have played against Navy so much and that even even if it's done.
8:  And now I've swung along with the the betting line to Notre Dame. I think that for all the intangible weird stuff that seems to happen from games in our Arbor, I think nor emphasis by week and Michigan's playing at Penn State are those are not intangible things. Those are real things. So I'm going to go with the real things and to being one point more important than the weird stuff and go with Notre Dame 24, Michigan 23  be a tough one. I am I have a feeling Notre Dame is going to handle its business, but Michigan is better than getting some credit for it home. I'm more than 27:21 range with Notre Dame at some point having that 10 point lead, but it just gets dicey, you know as
9:  Onto 3121 Notre Dame. They never look back. It's that possession doesn't matter unless the double the less the flipping halftime possession you score twice then it's been it's a killer for the other team which is the case in most games obviously. All right, we'll be back segment to burning up the boards.  We are in segment two of Irish illustrate Insider. It is called burning up the boards and we start with a question from underscore bd4 underscore how beneficial is a win over an impressive Navy Team for getting a new year six bowl. In other words. How much does IT project Notre Dame into that conversation to get the bid it does not because what's going to get Notre Dame in or keep Notre Dame out of New Year six bowl has everything to do with the other teams that are playing so
 
Topic 24 france yellow vest protests: What do people think were the causes of the yellow vest protests in Paris in 2019?  What topics in politics and economics did people touch on when they talked about the protests?  News stories about the protests are not relevant.
0:  Glasses here we go. Here we go. Wow, so obviously I live in the Netherlands as I've said before so my best friend Riley he was doing Exchange in Paris for the first half of last school year from September to December whatever so I'd probably gone, you know, I went three times and three months to Paris because it's like to take the bus is like 20 euros.

2:  To like be more conscious about the environment like where do you even begin like top three things to do definitely educate yourself? Yeah, because a big issue is like people don't know how to defend themselves. And I think that's how you like Lou you kind of lose run of yourself while you're doing it in the first place so educate yourself but not to the point but not to your breaking point where you're like, I can't decide the only thing I can think about and it's really causing you anxiety. Like I'm at my point now where I know all the information I'm not going to read anything in. Yeah, we're about it because I already know and then secondly is  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free.

I think I'm gonna like battle a little today, but I think the younger Generations are way more intelligent and compassionate.
4:  This is the time when students are coming out with junks people are raising their voices when we are saying that India is going to be super power 2020 that is average age of all. The people in the in India is going to be 29 years. That is the most amount of Youth in our country and still you think that we should be blindly sitting and supporting whatever the government is getting us.  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi
5:  you like these people I any of us forget the whole color thing for a moment, right? I think we all with our friends. We have great loyalty to them and we want to support them in any way we can and so when these people are your friends and you work with them and you're hearing all these stories, maybe you have an opportunity like I did because of the platform you're given and  Maybe you come from a different Viewpoint. You can say things that they can't and you can support them and I think any of us would support the people that we like and care about if given the opportunity. Yeah, it is interesting that I look at the the NFL and it was you know, obviously that's where Colin Kaepernick started the his protest lot of players decided to protest in terms of bringing attention to social injustice and Criminal Justice Reform at various.
6:  So let's take a look at the Spectrum. So just in case you guys missed it, the the for sort of pillars are politics economics distributed systems in cryptography. So we're going to start and we're going to talk about the economics first. We're going to kind of touch on some of the points there and we're going to make our way through the other pillars to kind of give you guys a broad overview of all the things that go into this this system. So first and foremost, we have the economics piece then what are your what are your initial thoughts that you  Of when you think of the economics well, and I encourage everyone to really dive into the Austrian economics here because as you know, as as Colin was asking me it's like how did I get into the economic side of it? Well, I got into it because I was trying to argue with people and I realized that I didn't have the knowledge. I didn't understand inflationary versus deflationary and and that's really a small piece of this. Once you start getting deep into this I think has lit in bastiat, but Henry has what's the one who wrote?
7:  In Yemen, that's the most it will do but a good news story does the same but the thing is as well. That's all it did really raised a bit of awareness and we're talking about work, but for me, I got so pissed off of it because you just see and I do regretfully going to say this you saw these white school girls going, huh? 7:10 your bed. Yeah. Look at me. I'm saved the world is that this goes to the Howard that started that that protesting all  Global warming protest Jesus. It was just unnecessary. What did it do? It was it did nothing. It means better while seeing it was just an excuse to have a little muscle program, which I'm all for but you don't need to do it in the name of environment during the name for fun. Yeah. Well, it was horrific. They didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I asked them. How did you at school today? Megan odds me mainly because really they came my car and I also said that thing you just got for a curry. Yeah, is that carbon neutral they said
8:  Those were not students and this has been confirmed by the police itself Delhi police arrested 10 students for violence and out of or tends to saying that those were 10 students, but when it was found out those were not the students but some locals who were judge who got involved in this protest and the middle for their benefit.  I'm not saying that protest might not go wrong. They might but it doesn't mean that we have to stop protesting.
9:  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi  I was ordered to Lottie what was ordered to encourage that he charged now a lot of you might also say that Delhi police did it it's nothing about our government our leader or our prime minister. Let me tell you how the leap on this works then leap police is not under anybody's control except the home minister of our country. Not even the state government.
 
Topic 25 black lives matter: What do people mean when they say “black lives matter”?  I am interested in personal reflections that give context to the phrase “black lives matter” and why it is important to individuals.  News stores about Black Lives Matter protests are relevant as well.
0:  Makes a man who himself was not free who is a fugitive from slavery guide for the freedom of this new nation?  All the way to now we see the black lives matter protest the we must acknowledge that it is black people who have fought more than any other group to make ideals laid out in the Constitution a reality.
1:  All the way to now we see the black lives matter protest the we must acknowledge that it is black people who have fought more than any other group to make ideals laid out in the Constitution a reality.  The Cornerstone of the series is an essay by Nicole Hanna Jones. So you just heard from and what she asserts the your 1619 is as foundational to the American story a 1776 the year the u.s. Gained independence. Why because it was in August 1619 that the first enslaved Africans arrived in what would become the US state of Virginia? This year is the 400th anniversary of the start of the transatlantic slave trade in America the 1619 project commemorates this pivotal moment.
2:  and  Black lives matters shirts and I'm not sure I like my ancestors shirts and all of these other things which that within itself as a whole nother conversation. That's very funny to me, but the dialogue on campus is

4:  A slave to their disproportionate recording contract that favors the record label a label most likely owned by white businessmen one could also be a slave to materialism using jewelry as a superficial validation of their ego and self worth a consumer mentality that doesn't disrupt the real Power Balance in America here on forward and within the context of Tyler's personal story. It seems Tyler's contrasting the chains of slaves and is jewelry to point out the irony of his success. He's written enough wraps to get a chain.  And now use them as feeding into the same Halo materialism that has left him feeling dissatisfied and as I'm questioning his motives and life in general Tyler continues. How many slaves can it be till Nat Turner arise? How many rides can there be tell them black lives matter here? We have another contrast of old and new as he references Nat Turner leader of a 19th century slave rebellion, and the black lives matter the 21st century movement concerned with ending racial and systemic Injustice around the world just like
5:  And now use them as feeding into the same Halo materialism that has left him feeling dissatisfied and as I'm questioning his motives and life in general Tyler continues. How many slaves can it be till Nat Turner arise? How many rides can there be tell them black lives matter here? We have another contrast of old and new as he references Nat Turner leader of a 19th century slave rebellion, and the black lives matter the 21st century movement concerned with ending racial and systemic Injustice around the world just like  Verse 1 Tyler's stream of Consciousness Begins by focusing on a personal confliction, but he quickly wins his lens to consider how his personal conflict fits within larger societal and historical constructs or issues in verse 1 Tyler question how much stuff you could buy until he's had enough and makes it change here. Tyler questions how much Injustice the black community can tolerate how many rallies are riots must there be until there's change as verse 2 continues. We'll see how Tyler weaves both of these questions together.
6:  And that's what I swim in building off the black lives matter line. Tyler references the shooting of young black men by police. He raps pew pew the n-word Life a game of basketball. He better shoot that N word because if that cop got Trigger he better pull with his reference to basketball. Tyler plays up The Stereotype that all black men are athletic as these types of generalizations of a race that often lead to unjust acts most relevant to this verse on forward. We think of the  unfortunate assumption made by some that black men are criminals inherently dangerous or threatening. It's these kinds of assumptions that led to the killings of black youth that sparked the black lives matter movement just referenced simultaneously Tyler Compares trigger-happy cops and their proclivity to shoot their guns to a basketball players proclivity to shoot a basketball as the verse continues Tyler shows how he uses his wealth and material Goods to escape these stereotypes wrapping his when I get pulled over I usually play it cool because
7:  They figured that out. Why can't you figure that out? We also hear these conversations in our households when we're talking to our parents when we see the things that we see on the TV when we see the black lives matter movement.  When we see, you know, all of these different instances or things that are shown to us in the media that make us think why can't these people just get it together?
8:  How many cases we saw Mike Brown's Body we heard that the horrific videos of Trayvon screaming we saw can leave out as Road to Suicide. These are all because of white people and then aren't you saw Sandra Bland we saw because he's fucking white supremacist. And that's what they are. That's all they are. These are mad white supremacist because black lives do not matter we can hashtag it we can we can write we can storm Tottenham for Mark Duggan black lives. Do not fucking matter.  And that is why watching something like when they see us, so why do people educate yourselves educate yourself do better? Because when you know better you're going to do better. Also, I want even if you keep making care.
9:  - game of basketball you gotta shoot that nigga cuz if that cop by truly better.  And that's what I swim in building off the black lives matter line. Tyler references the shooting of young black men by police. He raps pew pew the n-word Life a game of basketball. He better shoot that N word because if that cop got Trigger he better pull with his reference to basketball. Tyler plays up The Stereotype that all black men are athletic as these types of generalizations of a race that often lead to unjust acts most relevant to this verse on forward. We think of the

Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a  Start to you know to sad introduction to diet culture. But as you're telling me I'm thinking this is like so many people that I see this is an I felt so alone at this point. I remember sitting on the couch going what is wrong with me? Why is if no one's talking about it. I believed that it didn't exist that there was some fundamental floor. Everyone else have willpower. I didn't and I blamed myself for a long time by the time I'm 17. I'm deeply unhappy. I'm deeply disappointed.
7:  This is where am I eating? Disorder was kind of, you know going full strength and it's you know, I reach the goal. Even when I go to my goal weight though.

Topic 29 racism in canada: How does racism appear in Canada?  I’m looking for personal anecdotes about peoples’ experiences with racism in Canada.  Research such as sociological research is relevant if reported on.

1:  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and  Early intentional or if it is intentional. We're not going to admit to that right? So this this adaptation to make a racist really bad and you know, everybody else is good has made it virtually impossible to talk to the average white person about their racist conditions, right? And I think it's the root of all white defensiveness and I think that's what's happening when barbecue Becky is being told what you're doing is racist nice people and I'm sure she sees herself as a nice person can't all
2:  Across the very very special special ones who actually really really are interested in the sociological questions and in the epistemological challenges, and we've just started working on an ESL C funded project, which is trying to look we're not trying to it will look at how semantic web Technologies can be used for sociological research. So we're actually going to test drive some of the semantic web Technologies to look at in particular the relationship between social class aging and health over the life course, and so we've chosen deliberately really difficult social Concepts.  Is that sociologists themselves can't agree about the try and see what happens then if you try and describe those in semantic web terms, what are the challenges? What are the difficulties where do the differences between sociological thinking and computational thinking appear? What are the controversies? What are difficulties how do we transform them? So some of that's about the sensibilities and beliefs of the people and some of it is about how those are embedded in the artifact or the tools of the
3:  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.  So another another piece of evidence that white people often give is our minority status in another axis of social life. Right? And so the question that I would offer a white person who experiences oppression is somewhere else is what does racism look like in your community what a in particular anti-blackness look like in your community. What does anti-blackness look like?
4:  Offended when I discussion about racism occurs, so we look forward to doing what I believe is the Creator's will and that is for us to live this truth. Yes. I recognize that that is necessary in order to end racism. Could you begin by stating?  What your perspective is about the existence of racism? Oh talk about what what it is. Oh, I agree with the with the principal.
5:  Think Hmm and even just like one city over like Montreal gets worst Winters than we do. They get awful snow and cold Calgary to cover its really bad Winters and then obviously we have like all the way up North to the like Arctic. Yep, totally different the territories. Yeah, Canada is vast but mean we don't have any like deserts. That's true. Yeah the Prairies I guess we were actually talking about this. I mean, I'm sure there's lots of countries where this is true I mean, Mexico  Anywhere else, but somewhere like u.s. You know, if we want to move somewhere warm that's still in our country. Like we can't do that. But if you are from like the northern Us New York or something, you can move to Texas, Florida California or even just a different part of California and have different weather, but we appear in Canada. We all got the seasons. Okay, live t coming in hot with the questions. I don't know the exact answer.
6:  I am not racist, right and I want to challenge that and offer that niceness is not anti racism because niceness is not courageous. There's absolutely nothing Courageous about niceness anti-racism takes courage like incredible courage and risk and you are not actually always seeing as particularly nice when you  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.
7:  She said don't get she said Miss move it all that. Oh, my best friend is black. So she's saying that she don't want to hear that. Wow shots fired shots fired stated that you're interested in solving this problem and ending racism in your view if the system of racism white supremacy is ended what benefits  people experience
8:  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.  Important to say actually let's go granular and let's say I'm going to break down what anti-blackness is and in our I want everyone to sign up to that review of even within the black community because a lot of black people are anti-black also, they believe many of the messages that have been, you know communicating to them. They don't trust other black business owners. They think they're every black man is a threat and it will cross the road when they see a black person in a
9:  basically saying you don't see that we are different in any way shape or form and if you may not be racist potentially your parents or your parents parents definitely held some extreme views because the times at that Arrow was more allowance or allow a allowing of that and so it just is we understand that it's a funnel. It was a very big funnel and now it's getting narrower and narrower and a group of people that believe that and but we still have it. So yeah that that that's what was really kind of sort of living on my mind and really  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.

1:  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage. Now everyone who has experienced toxicity with their mothers has a different story. Sometimes the damage that is done is mild. Sometimes the damage is moderate and sometimes the damage is on a yalla yalla fix my life.  Life pstd level.

2:  Powerful way my no. I'm not lie. I'm leaning and like I'm leaning towards thinking not thinking that that that  this experience of motherhood has has been really fulfilling so far.
3:  That is time from fit last episode. I was a bit nervous because it was my first podcast this time. I was nervous because I was talking to Taryn Brom fit. It was actually the first time I ever met Taryn but as you'll hear we kind of become mates throughout the podcast as we have this really special conversation, and I know you'll love it as much as I did.  The podcast is broken up into three parts because we videoed at all and our video recorder only goes up to half an hour. Plus I had so many things. I knew you guys would be interested in hearing from Turin that I wanted to break it up into bite-size chunks and keep it all sort of logically flowing for you. If you do want to check out the vids.

I'm to chop the tree of your self-esteem down some toxic mothers will hurt your feelings and be Unapologetic about it. Now. I'm well aware that calling out women for being bad mothers is considered Blasphemous and sacrilegious in our society, but poor mothering is a real thing that affects millions of lives both men and women with toxic motherhood children are the victims with talk with toxic motherhood children.
5:  Glimpse of it. You take a snapshot line. And this is again. Like we're going to get into a big conversation about like body positivity through your body connectivity as a better word through motherhood the transition of into motherhood because that's like something I'm so fucking passionate about and that's like work I'ma blow your goddamn minds, but give yourself time. Give yourself time be gentle go slow be interested.  Curious. Yes be curious and get it with yourself before you bring in another human. Yep, right like we didn't really get it with yourself before you bring in another human in. This was my approach this time as well where I was very mindful in because I experienced prolapse this time around which is a whole new whole new fucking Terrain in the pussy department where I

This video is not for the listener who plans on buying their mama Mansion when they make it this video is not for that kind of mom, but this video is for my listeners who have been damaged who have been neglected who are resentful of their mothers who have been misinformed about their worth from their mothers and this video is for women who have grown up with a  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage.

7: Motherhood has been a really interesting topic and journey for us both, you know, as a same-sex couple as the parent of that did not biologically is not biologically related to my child. I think a lot about what that process and experience of motherhood means to me and how connected it needs to be to anything doing with Biology or not from a long time ago. We kind of envisioned a family where we might both. Biologically carry one of our children and so as we approach the decision of what to do with that plan of like each carrying one. It's like I've I'm on a daily basis still kind of pondering like do I actually want to be pregnant? We want that experience right? Do I want the experience of like being biologically related to my child how important all the are all these factors in this decision?
8:  And I think that I was really happy in that role as you're like support supportive partner. I really enjoyed I really enjoyed it. I'm continuing to enjoy my experience of motherhood as it stands. Right which should seems like now saying like that should inform like anything more than like, I don't know all this kind of  Worry and anxiety and all the contemplating of different options. Like I like I really liked the experience we've had so far why not replicate it. We're also in Euros is so good at it. You know, like it's like you take enjoyment at it, but like it was with so many things that like like I wasn't thinking about being this, you know in the first weeks and we were home together like as this new family and just me figuring out motherhood and figuring out this crazy postpartum body.

Topic 32 giants game december 22: I want to hear about the NY-Washington NFL football game played on December 22, 2019.  Why was the game important?  What were people saying leading up to it?  What was the outcome?  How did it affect the NFL postseason?
0:  Really? I've never stayed for a game. And even when the game is on I'm in and out of the game really the only one player that I can think of that really benefitted from a terrific game after having a nondescript week of practice was Pat White the quarterback from West Virginia back in 2009 who was all over the place and practice was phenomenally game ended up as a second-round pick never amounted to anything in the NFL. So the game is not important and the game is not important for a variety of reasons. You've got all these players who have to get some sort of playing time.  You see how the quarterbacks are on the field, you know, maybe throwing six seven eight passes. There are certain things that they're not allowed to do in the game. So the game is really not that important is the culmination of the week. It's almost like the reward for the players. The interviews are important at both the shrine game and the Senior Bowl they're important at The Shrine game because a lot of these shrine game players are not going to get to the combine. So this is sort of like their combine interview if you will, they will get interviewed again at the pro day, but
1:  Fires, I do want to ask you how much stock can players actually gain or lose during the course of the week. We here all week of players winning the week losing the week stock moving up stock moving down. How much can that actually take place in one specific week? And what's most important within that week is that the interviews? Is it the practice is that the game I'd like you to you know, maybe Enlighten us a little bit on that as well. The game is not important at all. I mean to be honest with you. Excuse me. I've never  Really? I've never stayed for a game. And even when the game is on I'm in and out of the game really the only one player that I can think of that really benefitted from a terrific game after having a nondescript week of practice was Pat White the quarterback from West Virginia back in 2009 who was all over the place and practice was phenomenally game ended up as a second-round pick never amounted to anything in the NFL. So the game is not important and the game is not important for a variety of reasons. You've got all these players who have to get some sort of playing time.
2:  I'm probably going to work on that. There's night or Friday night. I'll be at the Avalanche game tomorrow night, but I'll actually be in Jacksonville for the Chargers game in December. So if any of you guys were there, let me know cool. All right razor will let you go and then locks now wrap up here.  Take it easy guys. Alright ya later both.
3:  Okay, but but I but Benelli Put It Best in even in the rap game. Nobody will do what Master P ever did it again, but we back on top skate we back on top and we back on topic. They need to lose everything what you mean got his own thing the NFL or the football part of it will be something another one you feel what I'm saying? He can't make it has shoes clothes.  Moving CDs that he has food, okay.
4:  Double Juju and try to put Gilmore on on Moncrief to take them out of the game. They didn't even put Gilmore on Moncrief. He was just awful. I'm crying did I'm literally crying right now Big Ben's rid of Donte Moncrief 10 times in an NFL football game and he had seven yards seven years seven yard set seven yards. I mean this is this is efficiency almost on par with  Hogan Super Bowl 53 performance of six catches I mean of six targets for zero yards.
5:  I'm will have a running back. So it's not even going to be like a classic football game. You're not actually going to see the two teams as they are constructed go head-to-head. It's just going to be a mess. And so that game doesn't matter to me at all. Cal game doesn't really matter to me at all. You know, they're still without an offense of coordinator and they already had enough of offensive issues. I think you got those three important games and to me the Washington game was important as well just with everything that the Mountain West has done, too.  The Pac-12 and with people arguing that Boise State belonged in an even bigger possible New Year six bowl. I thought that that was really big and at the same time knowing that in the Las Vegas Bowl last year Fresno State beat the crap out of Arizona State. So I think that that was helpful for the Pac-12, but those three games of the ones that matter most yeah. Yeah. I just filled they did. I think that Oregon Wisconsin is important.
6:  It had like one of the easiest schedule set and the year. I really don't see many games. The Giants can win. I'm being honest with you. It's going to be a struggle or seizure dressed in november/december. It's another month of November. December were Giants football means nothing and yes, it's a rebuilding fit face. But like even though we're on a podcast right now. We're first fans and we want to see your team succeed and it's gonna be a struggle for these next few months just to watch this team. It's painful, but we're going to be here.  Here after every game and just going to talk about probably more John's losses. I mean, hey, we still got one more Monday Night Football game to talk about a giant sloth. That's going to be a good one.
7:  There's a this game has been passed along from some important people years and years ago, you know it at the turn of the century 1906. There was a question on whether to let this game continue. It was the rules need to be changed and we're going through a little bit of that nowadays. I couldn't to be a good segue. But yeah, but it and  number of colleges there was no pro football back down or a colleges were saying we're not playing that game anymore. They were there was some some problems many deaths injury that's one and ironically people look this up the man some what made the difference to kind of change and got got to gone was Believe It or Not Theodore Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt decided this was he loved the game of football. So in 1906, he gathered together a group of
8:  Just like I was letting you guys run with it. I have to I have to keep cutting myself off because I thought eventually ominous just keep repeating myself. I appreciate you having me on today. Oh, yeah, dude, for sure. Yeah. Well, we'll get you on again. We'll get you on for a full episode and not a little not bringing in halfway through and I'm excited to see what goes on the Frog. Yeah, right.  I'm probably going to work on that. There's night or Friday night. I'll be at the Avalanche game tomorrow night, but I'll actually be in Jacksonville for the Chargers game in December. So if any of you guys were there, let me know cool. All right razor will let you go and then locks now wrap up here.
9:  Name his rotation in his minutes and a snap counts were down a little bit. So he felt a lot better this week. So that's a good sign. And another thing, you know, the forest Buckner, you know, he's he's been on the on these bad night. Our team's he's seen what happens in Seattle. He had enough of it last year versus Seahawks at home and he put his stamp all over that game the December 16th game last year in San Francisco in the Niners pulled out the win. He sounded very much the same after the Rams game.  Mmmmmm speaking about the Seahawks like it did last year bunker knows how the importance of this game and I think Buckner is going to put his stamp on this game this week and you know, finally hopefully get this streak over in Seattle. Yeah, you know, I real quick. I want to touch on something that it was pointed out to me that Marshawn Lynch coming back for the for the Seahawks. I believe it was two weeks ago when we were in Santa Clara for the Falcons game Marshawn Lynch.
 
Topic 33 hvac industry environmentalism: What is the HVAC industry doing to promote sustainability and “green” technology?  Has it been effective?  What is the effect on people working in the industry?
0:  Things in a day because they're so busy putting out fires.

Topic 36 cryptocurrency risks: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies?  Many people are talking about cryptocurrency as an investment and it seems to have many benefits.  Are there any drawbacks?  What are they?  What setbacks have people suffered when investing in cryptocurrencies?
0:  So there it is the fundamentals of crypto. We've learned what it is what problems in might solve and how people around the world are using it. Now remember it's still quite volatile, but nevertheless what if you're interested in buying it for yourself or looking at it as an investment, you'll have, you know, six months in a row of Bitcoin up every month and it feels like a risk free trade. It's easy right just happens every month you make money and then people start getting greedy. That's alright Paul managing partner blocked our capital a hedge fund focused on investing.  In cryptocurrencies will be talking to him in the next episode and will be learning the investment side of crypto.
1:  If they have kind of no knowledge just go back and read about the history of when gold was banned here in the US and that's kind of just a great starting point to understand everything that followed that yeah, and it effectively cryptocurrencies are banned in India today. They have some of the already have harshest member harshest measures attempting to eradicate crypto currency exchanges and succeeding.  The milk for the most part pushing it all into a vast Black Market, but they're proposing even more radical measures. We're buying selling owning holding or even promoting and talking about cryptocurrency is that is not controlled by the government carries penalties that are heavier penalties than murder or rape. So 15 year sentences. Well, very very radical propositions.
2:  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait  Wait lists go through some complex. Use I that's tailored to a traitor not till like an ordinary consumer. And the worst part about it is you can't just buy cryptocurrency with a credit card or US Dollars. You have to actually bring cryptocurrency from somewhere else used it to get cryptocurrency. Well, this is way too much to ask for an ordinary person to get through.
3:  Ryan if we remember the definition, that means they can't pay their debt. So they can't redeem tethers for an equal amount of US Dollars the authors argue that there's a risk already associated with crypto currency exchanges. So exchanges are places where users can trade different cryptocurrencies people can also usually buy crypto currencies such as Bitcoin by depositing a fiat currency the authors argue that multiple strong relationships with different banks will help keep them solvent.  Third risk is if tether limited's Bank freezes, the reserve assets the author's claim that the banks are fully aware of tether limited's business activities with cryptocurrencies and believes that the company is in full compliance 1/4 risk is if tether limited runs off with the reserve funds, okay. So the authors argue that everything is transparent including the owners location and information. So any theft of funds would be easily traceable. The final risk is the centralization risk of pinning.
4:  Hey guys, it's great to be here.  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait
5:  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.  That gives you the credentials to sell cryptocurrency and a wallet is really just that grip that the private key. Okay, but I buy that you send it to me at five cryptocurrencies is the five top market caps. So like unicorny 3000 top 100. Yeah, that's okay. So you get top 100. I bought five you send me it and there's 50 bucks on there. We have packages of different packages. Okay. Now I got the key. Yes. Okay. Now what do I do with it? Great. So we have clients who?
6:  People doing bad things. It's all of the other people too. But you're kind of seeing all the same people that made mobile work. You're saying all the same people that made social networking work. You're seeing all the same people that made the internet work or early PCS work. So yes, there are some people here that are doing some bad things but there are a lot of other people here too. Now that we have a good understanding of Bitcoin. What about some of the other cryptocurrencies out there? And actually what's the difference between a cryptocurrency and a crypto asset crypto assets is sort of the more  odd term because there are certain types of crypto assets which are not necessarily currencies because one of the properties that you need of a currency is that it's fungible right like a dollar is a dollar and so Bitcoin is effectively a Bitcoin and they're interchangeable. Whereas for something like a Pokemon go card, you might have two different types of Pokémon cards. And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between
7:  About global cryptocurrency domination or what the nature of those conversations is like so if you can shit just I know he introduced you to bitcoin and that's how you got into it for those that don't know. What is the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like coin, you know Dogecoin, whatever it might be. Yeah. So Bitcoin is let's take a step back. But what is bitcoin why is that word all of a sudden the buzz in the tech community and in the world the media and all that why our governments talking about it? Like what the  You know what? Yes. What's the big deal, right?
8:  Your authors recognized with the proof of Reserve solution is not completely trust list and decentralized. The main bottleneck is that tether limited has complete control over the reserve asset. The first risk is if Ted limited goes bankrupt in such a case the author's state that the u.s. Dollars would still be redeemable. Another risk is of tether limited becomes insolvent.  Ryan if we remember the definition, that means they can't pay their debt. So they can't redeem tethers for an equal amount of US Dollars the authors argue that there's a risk already associated with crypto currency exchanges. So exchanges are places where users can trade different cryptocurrencies people can also usually buy crypto currencies such as Bitcoin by depositing a fiat currency the authors argue that multiple strong relationships with different banks will help keep them solvent.

I'm also extremely interesting.  It in self-development and self-help. I'm reading so many books and I'm just a sucker for these things. So let's talk a little bit about beware and what it means basically beware stems from being aware of but we're wearing clothes. So basically being aware of what you wear and I really like how this includes
6:  Um not working a part either college or traveling the world for sure with a boyfriend open, huh with a boyfriend. Well, I'll try to have a boyfriend. I was gonna say you better not be traveling the world with the boyfriend you'd better be traveling the world with the husband. Yes. Okay in 10 years old boy in five. Maybe you never know. You never know. Maybe I will be getting married at 21 well in five years. I hope to be married and have seven children.  Oh, that's not even physically possible as you have like five. Yeah, everything looks like five pairs of twins. I'm very much kidding. I don't that's not my goal at all. My goal is to be married. I might have children but really right now the goal that I'm working towards is publishing my books and becoming famous, please love me. Hey Ames.
7:  Oh, have you heard was like did you hear the kid? Did you hear about the kidnapping at school? It's fine. He woke up knee slapper.  What do you call a dog with no legs?
8:  Number two travel differently instead of visiting three new cities in five days choose to visit only one city this way. You can gradually immerse yourself into the culture and experience the nuances of daily life. This idea of a length in cultural. Immersion has been dubbed slow travel the method suggests. We linger in one place to really get the feel for it and take the time to learn the rhymes of local life without rushing from one tourist destination to the next you can even spend time doing nothing to allow for restful.  Contemplation of the travel experience slow travel allows us to foster a stronger connection to the place where visiting allows us a nice break from our fast-paced daily life. Number three cook from scratch instead of dining out grabbing takeout or reheating something from the freezer or form. I can try creating something original for dinner not only will the meal be healthier and free from preservatives and excess amounts of sodium, but it will also leave you more satisfied since the meal was a product of your own efforts.
9:  I've no idea a fortune-teller spelled like or chins and then what and then honey, huh good times.  Oh, have you heard was like did you hear the kid? Did you hear about the kidnapping at school? It's fine. He woke up knee slapper.
 
Topic 38 workplace diversity: What are things companies are doing and could do to promote diversity in the workplace?  Things like workplace programs, initiatives, education, and outreach are relevant.  Discussion about the outcomes of these efforts are relevant as well.
0:  On dating in the workplace advice. I don't know. I'm still trying to get you to sleep with me and it's not working. I'm  it's been a year. I mean make a move already talked about the t's man any last advice from you. Um, I mean, look, I wouldn't shy away from it. Like like I said, I'm a fan of like the workplace romance, but keep it to yourselves in a way, like don't let it affect the rest of the floor, you know, because then that can get awkward and sticky. I think we did a pretty good job of that people knew that we were like hooking up and like hanging out but like I mean I
1:  My dad. Yeah Dad. If you're listening to this on the Google speaker, I know you are stop right now also. Hello. I hope you're enjoying. My dad's name is Tony to to all the Tonys and yeah, okay, so I say, okay.  Up tip maybe like that's a try it go out. Yeah. Try it but make it make it low-key not like not in the workplace do something outside of the workplace and if it does end badly try to and make make it end on good terms because you are going to work there. Yeah and just like it'll it'll be awkward. Okay. I inevitably it will be auctioned no matter how well you guys end off like it'll be awkward for a bit but it will change like I don't get better you all forget everyone you will be
2:  Up tip maybe like that's a try it go out. Yeah. Try it but make it make it low-key not like not in the workplace do something outside of the workplace and if it does end badly try to and make make it end on good terms because you are going to work there. Yeah and just like it'll it'll be awkward. Okay. I inevitably it will be auctioned no matter how well you guys end off like it'll be awkward for a bit but it will change like I don't get better you all forget everyone you will be  Both forget that it happened not forget but like you won't really see the that situation every time you look at them and then other people won't see you as like people for each other like that went out that one time. Yeah, like, you know, I'm just go back to just working. Yeah, go do your work get out of there punch in punch out make your move. Yeah, just like yeah just go make money focus on your job. And then like what people work at like I know my high
3:  Millisecond assumptions and decisions that you're making right and then in the workplace you're making them about people right? And so that's when we can run we run into problems. And so when I talk about unconscious bias, I actually frame it as a sort of interpersonal discrimination. So we have no way of structural discrimination around like practices and policies but interpersonal discrimination occurs between two people and the way that they can affect us is that it can influence who gets hired.  How we get evaluated at work, which leaders are selected at work who is promoted at work? And so obviously it's something especially as women of color we should know about because it can impede our progress in the workplace. So some things that you know educate people about an organization's about is to have more structured processes or protocols in place, like for example, during an interview. It's really important to have it a structured set of questions as opposed to those off-the-cuff interviews.
4:  City it's kind of like saying we will only accept lesbians, you know into our business like we will only focus on helping dyslexics will let me help focus on lesbians. I'm not saying anyone's ever done that but it's kind of the same concept. It's like you're picking one stream as opposed to understanding how the neuro-diverse brain works how the what we call the right side has or the right brain works and looking at how you helped that group because  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how
5:  have talked about some of the experiences that they've had in their workplace and see if you can identify them in your own workplace and see if there are ways that you can start to help your workplace address them and for people who maybe do not identify as heterosexual also sort of do a self-assessment and think about some of the different topics we discussed see if you feel like those are common themes maybe in your workplace or in your experience and kind of see maybe  See how being queer or identifying as something that's not heterosexual affects your mental health if at all, it might not and you might be totally out and proud and maybe only positively affects your mental health, but if it doesn't sort of like start to self assassin check in with yourself and pay attention to the ways that your workplace or people you're interacting with maybe heightened some negative mental health symptoms for you and start thinking about ways that you can sort of make your brain feel better.
6:  Every day and so where you're at like with your energy and how you feel and your mood affects the people that you are trying to interact with and getting to interact with so if you're in a bad mood if you think everyone is out to get you if you just go to the negative side of things first like that directly impacts your business and and I think a lot of times we think we can fake it.  I've even thought of before like hey, I'm going through a lot. But like I'm just going to smile and people have no idea but people they feel it generally and it'll reflect and some other area of your life. And I believe that like all areas of our life are kind of connected. So if if things are off at home, then things are going to be off in the workplace and if things are off with your kids then like another area of your life is going to be impacted. So if you're not
7:  A mere show come from yeah. It was like all a dream. I think you look came up with the name and she thinks I came up with the name. Jeanne came up with a name. So what it is, we're brainstorming names and we're trying to come up with things that aren't sexist. The one that was the most like tongue-in-cheek that I thought was funny was Battlestar hysterical initially Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace was like the tag under the title. So it would be you know Battlestar hysterical Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace and  We kept saying this over and over and I was like, oh, it's just the tag and I was like, it just needs a sing-song under it's like Battle Tactics for your 6 is workplace and then no and so I recorded that and I sent that to Jeannie because I woke up the next morning and I was like, why did you listen me a voice memo it like one o'clock in the morning and it was you singing Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace. And I was like, that's all we need. We just need people to be able to Google it. You know, I think it's something really valuable in the name that it's just google-able.
8:  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how  Supported as a whole but we're not quite there. So what can you do in the meantime? So one of the one of the things that popped up in the group was around meetings and around if you're stuck in a meeting for an hour and a half and if you're in any business that has more than 10 15 20 employees meetings still seem to be at the Forefront of what companies think they're about, you know, you get stuck in those board tables and and usually someone who's got a left brain talks really slowly with it.
9:  Advance their career. So how does encouraging communication among employees that are existing employees help build a more inclusive workplace. In other words, you're not you're not bringing in new diverse people. You're just increasing Communications within the workforce share. So we're not bringing in new diverse people yet. That's in the vision for the future will tell us about that Vision quickly.  So the focus today is on inclusion because many companies do have efforts around diversity and bringing in diverse candidates. But where they fail is the inclusion component, for example, women are two times more likely to leave their job in the first year than men people of color it three and a half times more likely to leave their job within the first year then their white counterparts. And so why why they leaving didn't feel included
 
Topic 39 social media marketing: I’m looking for tips and suggestions for creating a social media marketing strategy.  What kinds of things do I need to think about?  How can I reach the most people online?  Are there companies that can help?
0:  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and
1:  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.  Has long been debated in our survey found that those social media is key to a marketing strategy 19 percent of marketers are still uncertain as to how to measure its Effectiveness. Right and a part of me thinks that there will always be an element of uncertainty to social media dark social as they call it. It's honestly nearly impossible to truly measure and Report the impact that brand awareness from social media has on the bottom line, but think about the trillions of private messages shares comments likes views and so much more that happened every single day.
2:  On social media, but it really hasn't come to fruition yet. So we'll see how that plays out this year. Yes, we will.  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.
3:  Before you take somebody on to help you with your social media. It's just one example, but get that it's I always think it's like you wouldn't get in a car without having a map or knowing where you're going. So it's just get that strategy right invest in that and then you'll be off and flying and it will make such a difference to your income and your business. Yeah, and I agree. Like I think marketing is probably the biggest area that people struggle with that and mindset but they don't realize the mindset is actually impacting them the way it is, but with marketing I  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.
4:  X I was telling people anything except for a tech startup which we all know better than to say that because that's where I ended up. So yeah that the full Journey I'm working at it. Now. I'm working to Tech startup that is in the film world. So there you go started with the CPA firm in Kansas all the way to this. Yeah. It's quit the quite the journey. I don't know. That's all you wanted to know. But yeah your listeners to know that I'm not full of crap.  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.
5:  College I do online school because that works best for my schedule. Maybe you that's really irrelevant, but just thought I you know put it out there this podcast is for entrepreneurs this podcast is for aspiring entrepreneurs business owners young talented people that are looking for advice looking for inspiration and motivation to achieve more reach for more.  And get to your end goals. So the kind of content you'll be seeing from us is insights on sales marketing entrepreneurship. You'll be seeing interviews with successful entrepreneurs in the area, you know, so I have so much plan and I'm so excited. It will be talking a lot about branding and social media and e-commerce and my social media marketing agency if that's something you guys want.
6:  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.  She and I think that's important because if the only thing you're doing is focusing on the medium, which is video. It won't work for you. Like it's not going to deliver what you're hoping. It's going to deliver at some point. It's going to feel an authentic here audience. It's going to kind of fall flat in terms of measurable. Like hey this actually increase their bottom line. I hope to stay home or whatever like whatever you're hoping video will do it will not if you're putting all of your weight just on the medium.
7:  You're basically just creating a social media kind of profile. Do you think social media is changing this world for the better or do you think it's such a classic question, you know this act now, you're gonna get me on a tangent. I get very frustrated with people's views on social.  Social media. Okay, because there's people like us who we like earn our living through social media. So for us like we see so much good in it and there is so much good in it. Like I mean we've both we met through social media, you know, like I've met many credible friends who social media. I'm so inspired by people. I follow on social media, but then there's the other side of it and those people who who feel incredibly self-conscious because of social media, and so I think it comes down to
8:  Do yeah sure. So and as an agency, we're helping startups and established companies sell more of their products and services for greater profit. For more money. Pretty much we do this by building a powerful Business website for them. That's gonna help them thrive in a competitive Marketplace. Then we help them Reach their ideal audience. It could be either on Facebook or on Google other social media or other platforms. And then once we have those visitors be then convert them into leads or customers.  For them. Wow. It's a whole thing in one room together. It's a marketing system that actually is composed of a couple of services. So like I said, there's a it's going to be a website some business marketing strategy online advertising design and photography and some content as well. It's a whole package sort of is but we're trying to like keep the focus on delivering or we say like help themselves. It's really a whole package and
9:  Hmm. Yeah, it all comes back to the bigger picture and the storytelling and exactly. Yeah, so that's definitely like where I see the Kata culture thing coming into play because there's so many there's like so many opportunities just for storytelling especially within coffee. Yeah. That's that's such an interesting approach. Like I really love that. You said now that it's gone. It's for now. It's an online community. So  You're basically just creating a social media kind of profile. Do you think social media is changing this world for the better or do you think it's such a classic question, you know this act now, you're gonna get me on a tangent. I get very frustrated with people's views on social.
 
Topic 40 bees dying: There have been numerous news reports of bees and other pollinators dying. I want to learn what I can do personally to help bees and other pollinators. General discussions about habitat loss are not relevant.
0: Hey everyone, welcome back to be on the talk of podcast formed in conjunction with Ted xuf and independently organized Ted event determined to dive deeper into the talks that you know, and love I'm Erica and I Virginia back in Action second episode of the podcast is season. We are very very excited because today is our very first interview. We put it into perspective. We're going to talk about the be in business recent years. You probably have heard a lot about saving the bees and the dying bee population is seen a lot of increased press according to the be informed. Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.
1: Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.  Beats, so obviously we should care about them a little bit, right? Yeah, no definitely super important and you have actually plays a very big role in this because they are the world's leading entomology Department according to the Center for World university rankings. And in tandem with funding from the state just spilled a four million dollar honey. Bee lab dedicated to the next generation of be research. So after gonna be he's no that's that's the that's the be in business. So here today. We have our first interview Robert Schulte. Robert is a third year here at University of Florida.
2:  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.
3:  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.  So that is teaching so many other people about the life cycle of honey bees.
4:  Queen bee and worker bees and a few drones at the very at it was very interesting. Finally at the for station. We played a true or false begin test our knowledge about the life cycle of honey bees here are some things each of us learned. I learned that all worker bees are females. There are hundreds of kinds of the  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.
5:  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.  So I think that's great. You know, you've got very Target audiences, right? You've got Growers. You've got beekeepers Etc. So, how do you how do you fund your extension program? Right. That's one of the discussions in our world is we what we got all these great ideas to reach beekeepers Etc. But that costs money. So how do you generate funding to support your extension program at Michigan State? Yes million dollar question for all of us, right? We've been very fortunate. It is a time that people do really care about bees.
6:  What is it that you and your lab do at Michigan State University in the realm of extension? What is it to you? And what do you do? And what are you trying to achieve? Sure. So the main overarching mission is to respond to practical needs in the agricultural Community my rules a little different than some of the straight beekeeping extension and apiculture is positioned. So when I started I've been at Michigan State for 5 years now in my current position  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are
7:  Offit that does research for honeybees and different insects, but I'm definitely going to meet with the honey bee lab soon here at UF to not only talk about the research opportunity. I spoke about earlier, but how we can support them as a business because at the end of the day, we all have the same goal of making sure the bees are people understand how important they are not only to like having honey, but how important they are to global scale to the environment because without bees there would be many crops that would kind of get the hammer and not be as successful as they were. Yeah.  Familiar. Do you have like any advice for people that are trying to like, how can they help bees in their own little way and no because it's not that mean I don't think everyone is willing to start their own little be if anyone's like thinking about maybe getting B's I would definitely suggest it. It's not as big of a commitment as you think it is. It's super cool to be able to sit like to say you have your bees and any any doubt you may have there's definitely like a counter argument against it and I'm positive that
8:  Recognize the importance and so I would say that we do focus on programs that we can fund. Plus we do have some general funding. So my position itself is funded directly through Michigan State University my I'm funded half through egg by a research and half the MSU Extension. And so that does give me flexibility to kind of operate on things that I find important either way for our extension. We've received funding from both the Michigan commercial.  Purrs and the Michigan Beekeepers Association, we received a grant through MSU Extension to develop like our pollinator Champions Course, but now that has become self funded in that it does bring in money. So that's one of the things that we're trying to do a little more is findings programs that can at minimum be self-supporting so that they can fund the instructors and fund the space and from the bees or whatever we need. We did get a really large.
9:  Minecraft new I swear I'll stop talking about cars. Also there was actually Minecraft news was first nice, right me and you both were like, they're not going to talk about anything important till Minecon. We're gonna have to scrounge up some random news such as how do bees were pants and we think we're sad wing.  So 115 snapshot came out. It is 19w 34A and we're going to briefly go over it because obviously it's going to mean the main topic of discussion. So the snapshot added bees bees nest beehives honeycomb a new dispenser functionality Java Edition now requires opengl 2.0. I hope that means it's going to be less buggy and laggy.
 
Topic 41 gmo food labeling: Some people say we should avoid foods with genetically-modified organisms as ingredients. I would like to learn about GMO food labeling. What are people saying about the pros and cons? What’s the difference between the European and US approaches to GMO food labeling?
0:  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.  Hey, if you're liking this content, Please Subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos.
1:  Hold on people one second.  All right. So yeah organic is not special organic is, you know, just regular Foods actually, you know, if you do your research, you know organic food should be able to be made cheaper than actual GMO foods, but you know, they trick us with the industry and make us think that these things are not so so, you know, my point of researching all of this thing is that people don't know the depth of the problem. So therefore they don't know the death of the solution and a lot of us we
2:  As lactose intolerant. I say you're lactose intolerant. You're not a baby cow. You are not supposed to be continuing milk after you breastfeed. That's all I got to say about milk you go. Listen to my whole show. It really Riles me up. Very passionate about it. Anyway some of the best foods for pregnant women to avoid processed foods, of course conventional foods high GMO foods high sugar foods colorings flavorings stick with Whole Foods thick with plant-based get away from Sam.  An American diet. I'm really important to know like the back of your hand. What foods are high in heavy metals particularly lead Mercury cadmium and arsenic as well as others, but those have been shown to pass through the placenta and if there is a predisposition in your child, sometimes these heavy metals can epigenetically cause changes to the child such that they may present with cognitive issues. So it starts way before the baby's born it starts with the husband or the
3:  Take vitamins and synthetic vitamins that are fortifying our food actually increase oxidation, but they're acting is oxidants anything that increases oxidation can increase inflammation and increase your risk of getting insulin resistance. So in summary, yes, it's true that the consume more bread, but they don't enrich it. It's higher quality. They don't snack as much they consume more fat. They consume less vegetable oils.  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.
4:  It's weaning off then it goes about its normal diet and goes back to running around or goes to running around and being, you know, Jaguar for example, so what where does this stand to believe that when we consume milk? We're supposed to be running around and it's a performance food. And when are we going to pay attention to what happens with the lactase enzyme after we wean after we wean off of milk that enzyme reduces and reduces and reduces so when people present  As lactose intolerant. I say you're lactose intolerant. You're not a baby cow. You are not supposed to be continuing milk after you breastfeed. That's all I got to say about milk you go. Listen to my whole show. It really Riles me up. Very passionate about it. Anyway some of the best foods for pregnant women to avoid processed foods, of course conventional foods high GMO foods high sugar foods colorings flavorings stick with Whole Foods thick with plant-based get away from Sam.
5:  All right. So yeah organic is not special organic is, you know, just regular Foods actually, you know, if you do your research, you know organic food should be able to be made cheaper than actual GMO foods, but you know, they trick us with the industry and make us think that these things are not so so, you know, my point of researching all of this thing is that people don't know the depth of the problem. So therefore they don't know the death of the solution and a lot of us we  I think that we leading our people in the right direction, but you end up killing your people. Yeah, I mean and that's why honorable Elijah Muhammad always said to joke too much joking is no good because yeah you go spread all this free publicity for Chick-fil-A and Popeyes em Tambo and at the same time what it all is done is creating more awareness. Yeah, I mean and in those areas these Popeyes and Chick-fil-A's or just going increase in sales yet those same people going to talk about black business all day, but you won't see them up there promoting black bear.
6:  of them are thin but I will say there's a big difference between the European countries and America. Okay, especially France and even Italy now the French consume a lot more fat the four times as much butter 60% more cheese a hundred eighty grams of fat from animal sources versus the US it's only 72. So in France, they're eating more saturated fats in America. We consume way more vegetable oil.  Like corn oil and soil which are GMO which can lead to insulin resistance. Okay, that alone can actually make you gain weight. They have three times as much pork. They have less high fructose corn syrup. I'll get to this in a second. They tend to keep their traditional foods. Okay, like in America, every single corner has a Thai restaurant in Italian restaurant a Mexican restaurant. You don't see that
7: Welcome to the dr. Berg healthy Ketone intermittent fasting podcast. Now your host the man taking your health to a whole new level. Dr. Eric Berg.  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of
8:  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of  Site, but even worse than that the glycemic index is a hundred and ten like table sugar is 70. This is a hundred and ten. I don't know of anything that's actually more than that. So you're consuming this sugar that will spike your blood sugar's so much compared to any other foods. Not only that the FDA does not include multiple dextran in the definition of added sugars.
9:  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.  There's no denying GMO when it's around it. Yeah, you know what it is.
 
Topic 42 fyre festival: Fyre Festival was a failed music festival which was planned to happen in 2017 on Bahamas. The festival was marketed through a number of social media channels, but the organisers did not deliver what they had promised the attendees in terms of accommodation and other infrastructure, and many of the billed artists never showed. The festival was the topic for several documentaries in 2019. I want to hear first person accounts of the festival, interviews with people associated with the festival, and about the legal repercussions.
0:  It was that it like ticked so many boxes in terms of like family Festival. So it was marketed as family festival and beforehand I was thinking is this thing is this just going to be like as it is that just like I mean look at the lineup is this as this is really going to be families. Yeah anyway, so it was loads of children running all over the place, which is actually quite nice. Yeah, the weather was excellent. It was really really diverse. I'd by far the most diverse Festival in terms of like age ethnicity bla black. So, you know, yeah that was  Great because like usually festivals are so middle. So like white middle class. I went to Glastonbury and for like the oldest Festival in the UK. It's like so like not on either arm is the ticket personal Brands and twenty hundred thirty quid that but that was like why appreciably chief that was right, but you're right at the end and yeah, so that was just like really really great. I would really highly recommend it to anyone who likes festivals. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's really feel like I've kind of play more
1:  DM me a tray of culture cast I usually reserve the official like Instagram account for anything related to the podcast. You guys can always reach out to me on my personal account a temuco POTUS if you want to as well, but okay with all that being said, let's get into this episode. So today we have on the festival finesse ER his name is Brian, but that is basically like his YouTube name. That's what he goes by the festival finesse. ER you guys can most likely find him roaming around a music festival hanging out on the  Mosh Pit front and center he wears these bright tie-dye shirts with his logo on them. He is a Jersey native to is awesome. So that's been really cool. We both have lived near each other which is really cool. We hung out at Ever After Festival. So he's in some of my Vlogs if you guys want to go check him out. And yeah and he's a content creator. He's got some really awesome Vlogs and music festival tips. That's his whole thing. He's really just trying to show people how they can finesse music festivals. And again, he's very into bass music.
2:  Friends and help get the word out about Reef Culture. Okay, I'm done talking about it. Now. I'm going to just give a quick intro into the topic for today's episode which actually was a suggestion from one of you guys. So thank you so much. I'm loving getting your input on what you guys actually want to hear me talk about so at Ashley underscore 21 send in a request for me to do a rave etiquette episode and since Festival season is happening. It's upon us right now. I thought I would just do this more about music.  Vowels and just etiquette in general for the EDM community. So we're going to be talking about a bunch of stuff today. I'm sure this is going to be a really relatable one because a lot of these if you go to a lot of music festivals you've for sure experience these and I know I have so I have more of like a list that I'm going to go down and we're just going to talk about what is acceptable behavior and unacceptable Behavior at Music Festival. But before we get into the episode, I am going to introduce a new segment to the podcast because as we do this,
3:  so when it's very light very much like like the new look kind of like jazz wave lots of live music from excellent live music but also with like the nighttime Shenanigans going on as well. Whereas Rosa it's at the same place to secret garden party. So you have it in. Yeah. It's a good good spot with Elation got bit of a got with a wood Vibe as well. Yeah weird vibe would survive and so despite the rain on the first night, like what made it so  It was that it like ticked so many boxes in terms of like family Festival. So it was marketed as family festival and beforehand I was thinking is this thing is this just going to be like as it is that just like I mean look at the lineup is this as this is really going to be families. Yeah anyway, so it was loads of children running all over the place, which is actually quite nice. Yeah, the weather was excellent. It was really really diverse. I'd by far the most diverse Festival in terms of like age ethnicity bla black. So, you know, yeah that was
4:  If that I want to share with you guys, so now we can get into the episode which I'm super super pumped about. So this past weekend, I actually had the opportunity to attend my first bass music festival and my first music festival in Canada. So two and one which is incredible and so there were a lot of first and I really hope to do a lot of Festival reviews here on this podcast. I wanted to dedicate an episode fully to talking about this experience what it was like so that you guys are a little bit more informed if you want to check this Festival out next year, you know a little bit  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.
5:  Agencies in orders, right? So no longer. Do you have to have the middleman? I think Billy and the documentary says he had to pay somebody to talk to job rule then had to pay another guy to talk to John Woo. And so he said know what rather than going into this method. Let's just cut the middleman out and let's create something where I can talk directly to the artists have their schedule and say can I booked you on a Surface? Great idea. I think it's a great idea to promote the site. They decide to create a festival. Hence the  The title fire Festival which would which was supposed to be sort of like a Coachella but on a deserted island island that he said he had owned in the Bahama in the Bahamas, but it wouldn't they want they want to throw a music festival in the Bahamas. Yeah. So promote the app. Absolutely. That's what it that's what they want. That's what they want to do. Yeah, and they figured so they were smart about it. They said listen rather will get some marketing teams. But the biggest way to promote something now is through Instagram just like you said it would fashion over the
6:  My partner and my brother built from scratch. He's an engineer. So they started using that to live broadcast all of their music events. So they hire us to go in and install that and they use it for the three days at the festivals on from there. Once we got into that world. I was shooting a lot of my own personal films at the time. I was shot one in Hawaii and the island of Kauai and I showed it to one of the guys on the production team at Red Bull TV. Well,  we were at one of the festival's just doing broadcast and they really liked it. So I kind of kept on them and kept sending them some of the passion projects that I was working on for Film Production in the hope that I could shoot some of the recap videos for their music festivals and lucky enough about two years ago. They finally had an opportunity at one of their big festivals and they got us to produce there after movie, which is basically like a recap of the entire Festival so
7:  we were at one of the festival's just doing broadcast and they really liked it. So I kind of kept on them and kept sending them some of the passion projects that I was working on for Film Production in the hope that I could shoot some of the recap videos for their music festivals and lucky enough about two years ago. They finally had an opportunity at one of their big festivals and they got us to produce there after movie, which is basically like a recap of the entire Festival so  Equally the job is to run around the festival shoot all the artists. You have a pass that lets you go anywhere, which is really really cool as a fan of music. That is something I feel really lucky to do so run around shoot everything and make a two-minute recap of the entire Festival in order to drive ticket sales for the following year. So on that in hindsight, it really makes me pump that I went out and did those personal projects that kind of had no point. I mean I paid for my own trip to Hawaii and
8:  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.  Blogs on my YouTube channel, which will be going out the end of this week and over the weekend. I got so much footage you guys I really went in this year. So it was also my first media pass which is super exciting literally was one of my main goals and I can't it feels surreal that that happened like when I started all this I was like, oh my God if I could create content and just travel to music festivals and do that like as a job, that would be my goal. So to actually do that this past weekend and be able to come back and have all this in
9:  The title fire Festival which would which was supposed to be sort of like a Coachella but on a deserted island island that he said he had owned in the Bahama in the Bahamas, but it wouldn't they want they want to throw a music festival in the Bahamas. Yeah. So promote the app. Absolutely. That's what it that's what they want. That's what they want to do. Yeah, and they figured so they were smart about it. They said listen rather will get some marketing teams. But the biggest way to promote something now is through Instagram just like you said it would fashion over the  Way to do it. Let's go through influences. So they have 10 supermodels like top-of-the-line. Super model. Chanel Iman is one of them Bella Hadid was one of them and they said you know, what? Can you just put up this orange burnt Square as the logo for what we're about to do right and every day at this time. Can you put it up and they do it and it gains traction and hashtag it fire festival and then they do something really
 
Topic 43 hong kong protests: Since early 2019, more or less continuous protests have taken place in Hong Kong, to mark popular displeasure with various aspects of power shifting from the local governing council to the Chinese central government. Students from the many Hong Kong universities have been at the forefront of the protests. I want to know more about who is protesting along with the students and what the popular sentiment in the general Hong Kong population is.
0:  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.  With cheap drums up just avoid the protest.
1:  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.
2:  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that
3:  he actually talks about Hong Kong here. And I'm gonna as it he was in he was in Hong Kong as I write from my four-star hotel and calm in Hong Kong which cost me a mere $25 per day I cannot but think about how erroneously risk is priced into the market when I arrived high at Hong Kong airport was eerily quiet with tourist avoiding it unbeknownst to them. However Hong Kong continues to be one of the safest place place.  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.
4:  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that  Hong Kong Polytechnic University and when they tried to storm it there was a fierce resistance. So people inside the university were they ended up barricading themselves into the school and to the university and fighting back with like petroleum bombs and arrows and Molotov cocktails. It was extremely interesting to watch and these people are fighting for
5:  Outsource our manufacturing and other jobs all over the place. Our immigration system is just fucked. So to me I'm like look, I wish we could do something with Hong Kong, but I don't see what we can do and then on a principle from a principled stand point. I don't know if there's anything we should do except stand in solidarity, but beyond that I it's not our fight if that makes sense. So anyway, what's going on currently is?  The students that were in the Hong Kong University, I guess they were running out of food and resources. So they all decided to flee and a bunch of people from the city are helping them get out. A lot of them are helping. So if you're not watching what's going on in Hong Kong, you should it's so it's just fascinating and we are seeing in real time how people are fighting for their freedoms because they know and I've said this already like this situation only had a couple ways to go either they get
6:  So as people may or may not have been paying attention the situation in Hong Kong has not stopped. So I talked about this months back. I mean probably four or five months ago talking about the situation in Hong Kong how I legitimately did not see a Way Forward except confrontation or there's really only two ways the situation is going to resolve itself. Either Beijing is  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.
7:  So but how would John so how would China starting riots make them appealing to Hong Kong intern doesn't just show that they can't control them.  The Chinese government had one the protesters to not play with fire not to underestimate the firm resolve the central government and not to mistake restraint for weakness. China could also be making the association that the Hong Kong government alone can't deal with such manic. So it is required for China to step in by the tenth week of protests. The airports are shut down due to protests on the 11th of August and the foot on the 4th of September Carrie Lam announced that she would withdraw the extradition brought together, but protesters said it was too little too late.
8:  True, this is Hong Kong ATMs. Run out of money is Bitcoin trading volume balloons again? I don't know how true this is. The situation in Hong Kong is the people are angry because China has too much control over Hong Kong in terms of what they're threatening that they want to if you commit a crime there they can try you in China. They don't like that which I don't blame them but  What would that all of a sudden cause a bank run at this point? And again, they're having protest there every day, but that would that cause a bank run that would cause the ATM's to run out of money and at the ATM's run it run out of money. I mean the Hong Kong government could just print more money and fill up the ATM's again. I mean there's I don't know right now.
9:  Jay on Pandora says the great he's been on my shoe before. He's a he's a straight shooter. He  he actually talks about Hong Kong here. And I'm gonna as it he was in he was in Hong Kong as I write from my four-star hotel and calm in Hong Kong which cost me a mere $25 per day I cannot but think about how erroneously risk is priced into the market when I arrived high at Hong Kong airport was eerily quiet with tourist avoiding it unbeknownst to them. However Hong Kong continues to be one of the safest place place.
 
Topic 44 thanksgiving comedy special: I remember hearing on the radio a comedy special recorded for Thanksgiving by Jack Benny.  Can I find it as a podcast?
0:  Never him playing with his friends as a kid going to the dentist. You know, that was one of my first comedy introductions is watching Bill Cosby himself. He said on stage in a chair and told this great comedy special and it was really funny and I don't think I've seen a single person do a comedy special since sitting on a chair on stage.  He had a rare Talent. Yes had a rare talent for drugging women allegedly and having sex with them allegedly. So oh Bill geez, but it's those stories. It's those abilities to tell you a funny story that you don't mind hearing more than once and you actually look forward to it. You know, I remember when Eddie Murphy came out with his first special Delirious. We all went to school the next day and try to tell each other.
1:  I mean unless you're somebody who has like Ron White has the tater salad Story. I mean that's that's one of those stories where you hear it once and you could hear it again and you just be amazed again. You'd like guys a good story because it's a good story. It's a it's a comedic story or like Bert Kreischer telling his machine story. It's a really good story or like, you know, Bill Cosby, you know before all the allegation didn't rape stuff, you know telling the story about  Never him playing with his friends as a kid going to the dentist. You know, that was one of my first comedy introductions is watching Bill Cosby himself. He said on stage in a chair and told this great comedy special and it was really funny and I don't think I've seen a single person do a comedy special since sitting on a chair on stage.
2:  Singing Man A Plan A piano and coming out of nowhere hitting them with the tap dance. All right, guys, this is hot. This is hot.

3:  And we don't do things that are special. I might have special needs like a learning disorder something. We don't do special positive right dude special a special exception right not special positive. Yeah. So there was something psychological and also I started out as like stand-up like open mics like waiting in line, like riding dumb jokes, like just sort of dumb early 20s, whatever and then I  I got out of that and I got into the Groundlings and an Acme theater and improvisational comedy and then I got into Kimmel and radio and MTV and you know Comedy Central and blah blah blah and it just sort of you know stand up was like something you'd try to beginning and then you'd move on and then if you got a paying gig like he got into syndicated radio or Comedy Central whatever then again who would go back and do stand-up and so was always
4:  Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42 ones dream is constantly evolving rising and falling changing course this happens in every job. But because I have worked in comedy for 25 years. I can probably speak best about my own profession.  Way back in the 1940s. There was a very very funny man named Jack Benny. He was a giant star easily. One of the greatest comedians of his generation and a much younger man named Johnny Carson wanted very much to be Jack Benny in some way. He's in some ways. He was but in many ways he wasn't he emulated Jack Benny, but his own quirks and mannerisms along with the changing medium pulled him in a different direction.
5:  What's up, guys Antoine Baines giving you that hot news and gossip. We have speaking of Cody Lee if you're totally fans. Don't worry. He is coming back later on this season for the live tapings. Also, he has something special up his sleeve Cody Lee also is not just a singer and a Pianist he is a tap dancer. That's right. What so you may see Cody bring something. I like we may win the show guys. You might win just picture it.  Singing Man A Plan A piano and coming out of nowhere hitting them with the tap dance. All right, guys, this is hot. This is hot. And also man if you are how we if your favours of how we definitely check out his special. This is his first comedian special comedy special in 20 years recently just been put out it is called. Where is it on Netflix? No. It's actually on Showtime. So
6:  Treadwell fired the whole ban and convince the vocal group The Five Crowns to become the new Drifters Atlantic Records handed production duties to Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who had been hugely successful with The Coasters this began the Golden Age Of The Drifters now just to put a quick Spotlight on The Drifters on this compilation. They are Benny King Johnny Lee Williams Rudy Louis Johnny more Charlie Thomas doc Greene Jean Pierson else.  Asbury Hobbs, that's a great name Ellsbury, Tommy Evans Johnny, Terry and guitarist Abdul Samad and Reggie Kimber. You think that's a lot well in The Drifters career there have been over 60 members, but guess what? I only have one member here with me today and I'm not talking about Micah Dukey. It's my guest Eric Griffin. You guys know him from I'm dying up here on Showtime from his comedy special americ and Warrior.
7:  Order to save the element on the ground. Do you know how about how far he had to crawl from the vehicles to the IED site? It was probably about 50 feet but 50 feet full of bullets flying in all directions. I'm sure yeah and not only to get there but didn't to have to think through step-by-step under duress how to defuse that that device. Could you see that from where you were or was a fart too far away?  And you heard about it after you got back. He was too far away and I remember hearing radio traffic about you'd he's going down to take care of the ID so that we can get to our turnaround point but you don't really get the full picture over radio traffic because there's a lot going on other than that and so I actually did not know that any of this happened until we all came back and we're going over our a are and how the mission went and so he had to be confident.
8:  And you heard about it after you got back. He was too far away and I remember hearing radio traffic about you'd he's going down to take care of the ID so that we can get to our turnaround point but you don't really get the full picture over radio traffic because there's a lot going on other than that and so I actually did not know that any of this happened until we all came back and we're going over our a are and how the mission went and so he had to be confident.  Enough to give the rest of the of a team a thumbs-up. Hey, we can go forward now because he's got to know if he hasn't diffused it correctly people are going to get blown up. And so do you know about how long it took him to diffuse that I think from start to finish it like starting from the vehicle from his place of cover going out and get rid of the hazard and then coming back it probably took approximately.
9:  Asbury Hobbs, that's a great name Ellsbury, Tommy Evans Johnny, Terry and guitarist Abdul Samad and Reggie Kimber. You think that's a lot well in The Drifters career there have been over 60 members, but guess what? I only have one member here with me today and I'm not talking about Micah Dukey. It's my guest Eric Griffin. You guys know him from I'm dying up here on Showtime from his comedy special americ and Warrior.  Is podcast riffing with Griffin and also play in Montez on Workaholics? Eric was the only person I could think of to do this record because when he did the jam he sang Soul and every song that he wanted to fuck in Singh was also and I was like, this is the man let's get to the root of soul and it's an incredible episode rate review and most importantly subscribe to the 500 guys and listen free on Spotify or anywhere you get your pods, but mostly on Spotify follow me.
 
Topic 45 drafting tight ends: I heard a podcast about strategies for drafting tight ends in football.  I’d like to find it again.
0:  I think Lamar Jackson makes a lot of sense and you know, even if you're drafting him as your QB 10, you're still getting him late. You're still getting him at a pretty good value. So I'm still cool with with targeting someone like him there, you know, late-round quarterback strategy isn't just about a game of chicken. It's just as much about a game of value than anything else and even if you don't get the guy you're targeting if you don't get Lamar Jackson, there's so many quarterbacks this year that I've even joked. You might not even have to take a quarterback this season like Sam Donald's going undrafted in a lot of places. He had a great preseason.  He's somebody you can get either with your last pick or maybe even off the waiver. Where early in the year if he's playing. Well, yeah, I mean streaming is a very very viable thing. I host a living this dream. I'm one half of that podcast, you know during the offseason. It's very much just like a lifestyle show. But in season, you know, we're giving pics each week at the quarterback tight end and defensive positions and at quarterback over the last five years. We've basically streamed a QB 6 Q B7 that's just using players off the waiver wire and not having the ability to
1:  Field ran a really slow 40 Riley Ridley did not have a good workout. And the worst one of all was Isaac Knott up the tight end Who coming into the weekend based on his film? I had him ranked in the top five as far as tight end prospects and was touting him to somebody as a later round not day one, but maybe early day to guy that I liked for Green Bay to solve their tight end issues or maybe pair him with somebody like the kids from Iowa or the Alabama tight end herb Smith.  And then he had a I think I think you told me before the show was over a square of 1 3 3 he ran a four nine nine forty. Okay still really bad really bad really bad. So 1 5 4 and then he ran a 4.99 40 and then I mean you just go through no tight end has ever succeeded without athletic testing like that. And this is a guy who is supposed to be a move tight end somebody who you put in space and make Place similar to the way the Saints used to use Jimmy Graham.
2:  And there was some injuries there. He had a bit of a calf issue that might have been slowing him down later in the season. He's going to be another great receiver next year finally tight end God what an awful year for this position. I mean so many injuries to promising players like Hunter Henry OJ Howard and we lost veterans like Delanie Walker and Greg Olsen. There was just so much turmoil at tight end this season and we knew going into the year that Elite tight ends were at a premium and two of the three.  He came through unfortunately, it really seems like we're seeing the decline of Rob Gronkowski here. We talked about that on a previous episode where he'll sort of fall next season. I think there's even a chance we could see him retire after this year, but a lot of time before that Zach ertz finished as the tight end to on the year. He was one of those Elite options who delivered Travis Kelce finished as the top scorer in tight end and that really makes him the tight end fantasy MVP for me ninety eight catches.
3:  And that depth chart spot that could maybe prevent some of these other guys from from really opening up into the offense. All right. So let's move on to signing players. I know it's weird for us here in Packer land to actually think about being active in free agency. It's not something that we are really, you know used to under the Ted Thompson regime. It was all about drafting develop goodykoontz.  To want to be very active in free agency. It's so I want to get two things. I want to start with this tight end has been an area of concern for the Packers. You know, Jimmy Graham got he signed last year. That was the big-name free agent. The goons brought in didn't really live up to what every Packer fan kind of had hoped that he would live up to sounds like they're going to bring them back and you know, and but then the other thing
4:  Heard about that the Ravens also passed up to draft a guy who effectively a backup tight end for them. But I think in the last few weeks of the Season, there's been a lot of things he's done pretty well and it allowed them this week to rest Mark Andrews heading into that game. So I think the overall strength of their tight end has been a huge huge boost, especially as you said that at the top of the show with the style of offense that Greg Roman likes to run having those guys  Perform at such a high level I think has been key. We tweeted out from our main account and this week that the Ravens are the only team with three tight ends with a with a PFF grade of 70 plus and I think I think it's three within the top 11 graded nice created tight ends in the NFL. So just the overall strength of that group is something that I think people don't really get Beyond Mark Andrews because he's been the headliner one here and one more PFF grading thing. That's us that's outrageously good.
5:  And to play tight end and that obviously worked out tremendously as he was Pro Football Focus is number one graded Tenon and all of college football last year from receiving standpoint. And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.
6:  10 times last year pretty ridiculous what you know speaking of tight ends Tom before we get into our rankings. We really should break down the some of the news that's come out today. Apparently the Giants are sending an MRI of Evan engram foot to dr. Robert Anderson. Who's one of the foremost foot specialists in the country. We have no update on that right now, but it does appear that the Giants are concerned about Evan engrams foot injury. Which would I mean look, he's a top  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.
7:  It on high-end running backs and I'm talking about getting the top end running backs. One of the reasons why I'm willing to come away with just one workhorse and then fill out my other positions because my second running back is the spot that I'm willing to gamble on a later pick or fill up on handcuffs later in the season and try to get that guy that's going to lead me to a title if you're going in with just with nothing with no Workhorse backs. I'm very worried about you. I don't know that you're gonna be able to fill two of those slots in a season. You're going to have to be  Are very good at drafting or very very lucky with injuries. The top three tight end is a big Advantage. I want one when I can I've definitely gone that route a lot this year, but I'm also really willing to let that slide. I'm okay with scooping up an old J Howard or Hunter Henry or Jared Cook or even a Vance McDonald later in the draft. So I would definitely say if I'm if I'm ranking those in order of preference having the one workhorse running back would be first going after a top-three tight end would be second and the

So I would definitely say if I'm if I'm ranking those in order of preference having the one workhorse running back would be first going after a top-three tight end would be second and the  The 0 RB thing. I'm willing to just pass on at Salomon 33 John Dante Pettis is available in my 10 team PPR league, but I'm unsure who to drop for them Lamar Jackson Andrew Luck David Johnson Philip, Lindsay Marlin Mac, David Montgomery. Dion Lewis, Austin Eckler. All Sean Jeffrey Marvin Jones Jarvis Landry DK, Metcalf, Calvin Ridley Travis, Kelce no defense on his team.
9:  Oh and obviously knows a little floor offense and then Max Williams of the Ravens another really good blocking tight end well-rounded run and pass blocking. So that's the kind of tight end. I think they should bring in veteran short-term inexpensive who can block so you don't see a to tight end system with Jimmy Graham and Jared Cook at all. I don't I think it's too expensive 20 million to the tight end position is a lot. All right and Maggie, what do you think? Just should they go after cook it? What do you see the  Workers doing there Paul and I agree on everything today and it's not fun. I think I wholeheartedly agree. I would like to see the Packers address the tight end position maybe in the with the 44th pick in the second round. I think my preference would be to see them go edge o line or maybe Edge even with the the first round, but I also definitely agree that there needs to be a veteran in the lineup and I broke down the tight end.
 
Topic 46 missouri quilt mom: I listened to a podcast about a stay-at-home mom in Missouri who opened a quilt company and I would like to hear it again.
0:  Yeah, there's one I'm working on right now. I just stretched it yesterday and I haven't posted it yet. And I'm like so sad about it. I don't know if I want to quilt it this year. Oh my gosh, because I want to revisit it. I love it so much more adorable. But you gift these things are these gifts are they like things that you hang onto like what you know, yes, I do. Give away. Like I make a lot of baby quilts.  When my ma is have babies and stuff like that. But yeah, so a lot of the ones that I make are just like I'm making up the pattern. So yeah, I just I just make the I did give one away to oh, who's the girl who started PMG holla when her mom died, I think I sent her a quilt because I'm so grateful for like the groups that came out. I don't I'm not on PMG more. Yeah. Yeah all this whole connection that we
1:  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to
2:  Okay, and so then my Five-Year Plan is so I spent seven years living a dream. Basically. Yeah, it was a dream seven years living that dream and then I quit abruptly to be a stay-at-home mom. And so the thing for me is like I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't quit my job to have  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that
3:  Calm just so peaceful and she's a stay-at-home mom. And I just feel like she really just fits that role. So well like she is intentional with her kids. She enjoys she's content being a stay-at-home mom and she likes she likes that role and she's really really good at it. And she's really patient with her kids and guys if I'm being honest, that is not me.  Me I am not so patient with my kids. I am not content with being a stay-at-home mom. Like I just I don't feel like I fit that role well and so having her as a friend really balances me out and makes me you know realize that there is joy in motherhood that there is joy and staying at home and some of you are probably listening and thinking I'm a monster but that is just the truth. And so even though she is so different than me.
4:  no, you're a stay-at-home mom.  Do you feel like that would be suffering?
5:  You from Waynesville you're at side there. And what are you doing there? So I was going to a small little Community College Ozark Tech. And those are Christian like take in one of the it was around my last year and I needed to apply for colleges because I knew I wanted to do theater in Missouri Southern came out. And yeah, they told me about it. So I applied there. I applied it, Missouri State also.  But I didn't hear back from so I just I just went to Missouri Southern so now you're lying. Yep. There we go. Do you like it? Do you live in the dorms or off campus on campus? Yeah, I like it in. Yeah, I do live in the dorms is doing his all right. Yeah. Yeah, which dorms are you in? I've heard different. I mean it's taking like you hear you're primarily hear about playing. Yeah, they missed a gear good like better or worse. It's better a better.
6:  I love I love hearing that because I think there's a lot of people in our audience right now who kind of fall under that same almost like ideology. It's like this is what my parents did and this is what I'm going to do two and that's not a bad thing. I mean, my mom was a stay-at-home mom my dad work from home. So that was like a different thing that my friends had but oh that sounds fun. It was a lot of fun because like there were times. It's like Dad. Let's go outside and play baseball and he would drop what he was doing.  He would throw the ball with me in the backyard and it was the greatest. I love it. Yeah, it was so good. Ellie's parents were the same way. Her mom was a stay-at-home. Mom. Her dad went to work and look at us now. We're full time YouTuber. So it's like it's a little bit different but you know, that's not to say that it's a bad thing. It's just I feel like a lot of people need to hear that. It's okay to do something different. There's more than one right way to do things and I love the way that you found it out.
7:  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to  Time to figure that out. I was listening to the love our podcast and they had some guests on there and they were talking about how like in this when Melissa was going through her similar transition as far as like her career path to becoming an entrepreneur in doing out things. She has this thing where she's like space and Grace like give me the space in the grace to be able to figure things out. But her guest on the podcast was like not only space and Grace but
8:  I feel like  Being a sing. I'm a stay-at-home. Mom is like Typecast like it's not just that you know what I'm saying? Because you know you do a lot more.
9:  To do these quilts, uh-huh. It probably does but it doesn't feel like it because I don't know. It's sort of like it takes all this time to do a marathon right like you right now. Yeah, well steps and totally while you're doing the little steps you enjoying them so much. You don't realize they're all coming together to make this greater thing, you know. Yeah, and so you don't think about you know all the hours you just think about the how fun the process is, you know, yeah actually get really sad when it starts to die down.  Yeah, there's one I'm working on right now. I just stretched it yesterday and I haven't posted it yet. And I'm like so sad about it. I don't know if I want to quilt it this year. Oh my gosh, because I want to revisit it. I love it so much more adorable. But you gift these things are these gifts are they like things that you hang onto like what you know, yes, I do. Give away. Like I make a lot of baby quilts.
 
Topic 47 sci-fi author interview mars: I heard this interview with a sci-fi author who wrote a book or books with “Mars” in the title, but I can’t recall his name.  I’d like to find it again.
0:  Can you tell us more about your book? I mean, you are an author you wrote two books about data. Come on Pitch it okay. Thank you. Well, I wrote the book specifically for people into camps. The first Camp is people who are not in a data position, but really want to be data driven and think that what I've said earlier is really essential to their career and they are very very busy already and they want  you just have something very simple and very brief to go over and have a manual that they can just flip to the page that they remember and
1:  From talk with people who work in the data department and then probably get started on learning the basics like Excel or SQL. And and if you're allowed to you'll be able to query databases and find the answers for yourself. Mhm. Yeah. I have another interesting resource. If you want to start learning some data. There's a book called Data Mastery wrote by yours Lauren. So can  Can you tell us more about your book? I mean, you are an author you wrote two books about data. Come on Pitch it okay. Thank you. Well, I wrote the book specifically for people into camps. The first Camp is people who are not in a data position, but really want to be data driven and think that what I've said earlier is really essential to their career and they are very very busy already and they want
2:  Days of presentations and my plans to get a whole bunch of interviews for the podcast kind of fell apart. So hopefully you got a chance to hear Bob Dylan yesterday or and and the last episode and of course when I say Bob Dylan, I'm not talking about the you know, the musician we're talking here about Bob Dylan the learning space author, but what I wanted to do and a couple of episodes here was kind of like  Take down some of the things that I learned while I was at a few TC so I can at least bring some of these things back to you. And so today I thought I'd tell it tell you a little bit about the opening keynote, which was Daniel pink. Now Daniel pink is an author that I have admired greatly for a long time, you know, he wrote a book called Drive, which is all about people's real, you know, what really motivates people but most recently he wrote a book called.
3:  List of bye. Bye. Bye, you know, that's it's just such a turn-off. It is a turn-off. One of the things I do is I ask people to take a picture of themselves with my book and I'll create collages and I'll just Express enthusiasm. I love seeing people's beautiful faces with my book so you can you can share those types of things. You're not overtly selling the book but people will read the title and the like that sounds interesting and so I  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people
4:  If you missed our first podcast, you can check out the interview with Joe siple a tanker dot f m / Black Rose writing and upcoming interviews in the two weeks will be the author of the fiction book of the Year managed care. Joe Barrett is the author and that will be an exciting interview. So hope you tune in for the third episode. This is Reagan Roadie the  Host of Heard It Through The Rose Vine signing off those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.
5:  because I have enough privacy. It's like a to be read pile, right? Yeah where I'm like, okay, I think that this could Inspire because it's about this bubble up and at the end I was like, so if you have any recommendations for books about young women trying to find themselves in the world like 20 year olds or a book that gets a little weird. Please recommend it and multiple people recommended sourdough and they were like, it's by the same author who wrote mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore and I  Like that's so crazy because mr. Penumbra's was such a big book and I never heard anything about sourdough. Like I never heard anyone mention true. Yeah, so I looked it up and I was like, yeah, this actually does sound kind of cute. Maybe I don't know I'll kill it was like now in the back of my mind and now last week raelene had visited here and we went to a book shop together and I saw this book just randomly on it on a sales table for seven dollars and fifty cents and I was like, okay. Yeah.
6:  Cash and Nene you really didn't know which author wrote was because both all the characters was like some some Thug as motherfucker. So, you know people will do my sneaky and conniving so it's like you really did not know who wrote it and that's why I really like that Series. Yeah, that makes sense. I  I don't know. I've always wanted to do a collab, but it's been AA and and see another thing about a collaboration another thing about a collaboration. You don't want to pick up Arthur.
7:  That collab and I read each other's effort. And I know they can write but once that collaboration happened is like is not how I thought it was going to be. Yeah, I do. I'm not I'm not big on collaboration. Yeah, I've seen it happen before I've read a collab where it was like obvious who wrote would any kind of like right and see I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah. It was like now one one book. I did want to leave. I did like by two ought to do was trust no bitch. Bye.  Cash and Nene you really didn't know which author wrote was because both all the characters was like some some Thug as motherfucker. So, you know people will do my sneaky and conniving so it's like you really did not know who wrote it and that's why I really like that Series. Yeah, that makes sense. I

So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people  People who have podcasts people who write blogs people who post regularly and just write them and say, you know, I thought you might be interested in a free copy of my book. Which would you like me to send you one and you don't ask them, please write a review or whatever you I mean it just sort of takes the beauty of the gift away when you have when you immediately make it Tit for Tat, so I always buy extra copies of my
9:  Different sort of energy that I feel here now versus when I didn't really know the place as as well, you know, and so now that I know it it's kind of like the magic is kind of peeled back a little bit but not in a bad way. I just see things more clearly now, it's like I don't know but I feel like that's about you know, that's in regards to everything that I experienced now like every, you know, first date every this everything that used to be just so, you know shrouded in mystery is now  Oh so much clearer and I actually was reading this book. I'm reading this book called on it's called The Rules of Civility and I actually don't remember the author's name, but he also wrote a gentleman in Moscow or the gentleman in Moscow don't know about actual title. I haven't read that book yet. But he also I think his name starts with an A. Whatever doesn't matter you guys can Google Rules of Civility and it'll come up and basically it's a book written about New York, which is very cool. It's a very awesome storyline. I really really am into it. I'm halfway through. I've been reading it for a week.
 
Topic 48 spike lee movie score: Spike Lee movies have well curated scores.  I heard a podcast interview where he talked about one of his movies and the process of curating the score.  What was it?
0:  We need mentions for he's like, hey, you guys want to come to see a screening of Chiraq? What and we were like, yeah. Yeah, of course. Yes, and so we got into a town car with Spike Lee and his driver and we thought were going to like a proper Premier. So yeah, but it was a screening room where they were still like doing the final editing touches on the movie we should and it was a screening room kind of like a if you had a nice home theater, like it was a room like that me and Kevin sat down to these like these baller chairs.  All made from like unicorn hair and a and reindeer and reindeer quills or something and we sat there and watched Chiraq that sounds like a Spike Lee fantasy sequence from like it - like when we when we make the movie about the podcast we're mean Kevin play ourselves and is directed by Spike Lee. Yes. It does not please himself. Yeah the walk to the Spike Lee screening. It will be on the that that standard Spike Dolly shot where we're floating over the ground.
1:  All made from like unicorn hair and a and reindeer and reindeer quills or something and we sat there and watched Chiraq that sounds like a Spike Lee fantasy sequence from like it - like when we when we make the movie about the podcast we're mean Kevin play ourselves and is directed by Spike Lee. Yes. It does not please himself. Yeah the walk to the Spike Lee screening. It will be on the that that standard Spike Dolly shot where we're floating over the ground.  I had to leave in this like to on our into it an hour and a half into it because I had to go be on CNN. I was on my phone during the screening trying to get out of it because I was doing all these text messages and emails trying to get out of it and they said no and I was like, I was like a half second way from texting. Well, then screw all y'all I quit the entire thing. Like I don't need to quit his job. That's segment know the CNN show working for CNN. That's Show Business.
2:  Sex is not like scissoring which is not real. It's not a thing. It doesn't work wasn't I know but I just I was like, this is dope. This is huge. It was such a small thing, but it was such a like empowering thing because we see, you know, we see pound town for hetero couples all the time. So it was just nice to see a switch up and it be intimate and beautiful and sexy and not not kind of like overly sexualizing them and the way that like a lot of  X lesbian couples can be made on TV. It was just like this is sex and it's dope and they're having a good time. Yes. Um, I really enjoyed it. I feel like the audience enjoyed it too. Sad to see someone. No, but also we get a look at Nola's X's. I remember when season one and and I was like damn I wonder if any of the guys are going to come back. I wonder how they're going to do this because if anyone watched the original movie It Ends how season 1 ended but that's all Spike Lee did was just this one movie. So sometimes when you take a movie and you make it into a
3:  percent off federal and state filing  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.

I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.  Story of a pivotal scene where Jesus who's played by Future NBA Hall of Famer Ray. Allen is supposed to be his father in one-on-one game. It starts with you asking Spike a question about the movie swell, and there's a fizzle famous story and I feel like we want we've heard it from other people but here from the from you the one-on-one game. Yes. All right.
5:  X lesbian couples can be made on TV. It was just like this is sex and it's dope and they're having a good time. Yes. Um, I really enjoyed it. I feel like the audience enjoyed it too. Sad to see someone. No, but also we get a look at Nola's X's. I remember when season one and and I was like damn I wonder if any of the guys are going to come back. I wonder how they're going to do this because if anyone watched the original movie It Ends how season 1 ended but that's all Spike Lee did was just this one movie. So sometimes when you take a movie and you make it into a  I'm like damn. What are they going to do with season two? We got to see the guys and we seen the guys we've seen Jamie working it out with his wife / ex-wife. It looks like they want a divorce in the divorce is on the table. We see Greer kind of just living his best life and still being a hot ass hole and getting a beautiful man. And she's and Noland we're still hanging out and we also see Mars kind of try to live as best life and losing his job and getting kicked out of the house with his sister. So do you guys have a favorite guy? And were you expecting all three of them to be back?
6:  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.  In mounts and he walks in by himself. No Handler. No extra person. He doesn't say too much and it wasn't till he sat down and we actually started recording and he goes what's up young brothers and we all laugh but I realize oh, he's here to have a good time. Like he and he that's what he let us know. He'd listen to the podcast more than one episode and he reference ever there episode. I mean, I understand this and I think Henderson the only reason this podcast can exist is because of the four movies that Spike did with Denzel. Yeah.
7:  Suzanne gatha. Yes. Yes. So the lady that plays Nola Towanda wise actually had to turn down a role in Captain Marvel. Whoa, which is so crazy because of the time conflicts on the scheduling conflicts that happened with this show which is such a crazy huge franchise to turn down. Like I always wonder like what would have happened if she was able to take on that role? How would it have changed her?  Career, but I think that also shows some like loyalty and commitment there that you're going to stick out with a Netflix show like a Spike Lee. I Spike Lee Netflix show over like a billion-dollar franchise that would have been so, you know, you know what I think I am happy that she turned it down because if you think about it, like she's got to have it is De Wanda like the one is the star she will now go down in history and being like she is spot. She was the head person. Whereas I Captain Marvel have been great for her bank account and great for her and her husband.
8:  Because like I don't like subtlety and I Spike Lee doesn't like subtlety and I think what issues like that where it really is affecting the lives of people like with what's all boys name that got arrested last season and is out. Oh Pop. Oh Pop. Oh like I love seeing like very real tangible examples of what the effects of gentrification has on people like with him and with Mars and love it kind of getting thrown in your face to the point where it's uncomfortable because it's like this is real. Yeah. Yes, I agree with you but I do agree that the end was a little long but that's like this.  Polly history Jack has a thing where he takes something like a piece of art and he will literally stretch the scene out for 20 minutes like okay. Yes. I was still going so that's like a thing with Spike Lee like I love but that I had the same reaction where I was like, okay this little long but I love it because as your even though you're a little annoyed you like. Okay Spike. I see what you're saying. Yeah, that's what I got for me, but the second was definitely hell along. Thank you spike before we close out episode 1 because we're going
9:  Career, but I think that also shows some like loyalty and commitment there that you're going to stick out with a Netflix show like a Spike Lee. I Spike Lee Netflix show over like a billion-dollar franchise that would have been so, you know, you know what I think I am happy that she turned it down because if you think about it, like she's got to have it is De Wanda like the one is the star she will now go down in history and being like she is spot. She was the head person. Whereas I Captain Marvel have been great for her bank account and great for her and her husband.  Yeah, but she just would have kind of been like a plus one which isn't a bad role but I just think what she's got to have it. This is her. This is my home. She gets to have full control of her character and shows loyalty to fight and I will also say yes to all of that but I also say Hollywood has this tendency that once there's a person of color who's popping. They want to they and they want to play the representation in game. They push that person onto everything onto every project. We've seen it, you know and Asian communities in the Latino community.

So I'll go get everything from the thrift store and maybe by the beds of course new in the Linens of course and the towels but everything else thrift store or you know, somebody just passing things down. Yeah, I mean there's a there's a lot of people that will just let you have have their stuff if you offered a pick it up. Yeah, you can look at Craigslist for that and we've had a lot of course that that are kind of on a tight budget.  They have a lot of good with like crap, you know crowdfunding and you could do that through Facebook now when I got you see those posts. Are you on Facebook?
5:  Focus and so we had a little tiff about it but long story short we went to the car place. It was a terrible experience. So on the way back he was like if you still want to stop at the thrift store, let's do that and I hadn't thrifted since we went to the beach, which I don't know if I told you guys about that I probably should tell you about that too. I digress.  And it was lit, I got so much good stuff. So I was glad we had worked out our little squabble though because every song that was playing in the thrift store was like one of the saddest country songs. I may have ever heard every single one. It was kind of hilarious. So I'm listening to sad country songs and sorting through the most amazing Thrift some of the finds that I wanted to tell you guys about was I got for Vintage House dresses.
6:  Alms and I just felt like I didn't belong there. So yeah, it's just very interesting. We got out and we were we got a public housing. So we got a house and I thought all my problems would go away, you know once we got a house and it was a nice place frankly, but I just more followed man, my mom had to work and she got her van repoed. And I mean this the list goes on and on but it's kind of  How I can look back and start to connect all the dots in my life thrift stores. We shopped at thrift stores all the way up until shoot. I think my last year in high school or even to this day. I mean all my stuff is from thrift stores and some people don't realize you know, the good gems you can find you guys do so.

I mean all my stuff is from thrift stores and some people don't realize you know, the good gems you can find you guys do so.  But yeah, I mean that's I found Sports. I kind of put all my anger and frustrations into that and just kind of made it man went to college and I played football and I ended up tearing my shoulder my senior year in high school got surgery and then when I went to college I tore it again. So I was like, you know what it's time to hang it up and I think in general man, you gotta you gotta find
8:  One bathroom three bedrooms. I'm like, okay, that'd be perfect for my men's sober homes. I'm like we can we can crank that out. You know, she's like, you know, ask her anything more about it. So it'd be interesting to see because I know she's got out she owned a restaurant once before so she's got all this furniture from her restaurant though. Maybe she's got some enough chairs for us to do the dining room table. So it's the something so she may already have because  I love the thrift store. So I'll go get everything from the thrift store and maybe by the beds of course new in the Linens of course and the towels but everything else thrift store or you know, somebody just passing things down.

9:  The toys and I found this like $30 toy that was like two dollars and was like, I couldn't believe that I got this toy when that happened fire was just lit inside me of like I can't believe that this is real like that. This can happen. That's the best origin story ever. And your dad is my hero. He's my hero too. He's the best. That's the best way to tell somebody about a thrift store ever. That's what I tell my kids to and we go  yard selling and I'm just like babes.

Topic 52 fauci interview: An article about COVID-19 referenced an interview with Dr. Fauci that took place when the virus had not yet reached the US.  I would like to listen to it.
0:  she spoke to me. She's like hey, what are you doing? And I was like, oh nothing and she was like well take a look at this and like check this out and we did and we went through like an agency everything and like from the air just like like fire and just it just happened. I'm just yeah, like I got RM like signing up doing everything put in my profile online. And then the first this is actually the first camp that like send me an interview and I accepted it feels kind of strange things like essentially what happened.  We were supposed to get a Skype interview. Okay, and then they're like decide if you want to do it and Ross was actually kind of like cheeky and it just went exceptionally anyplace me and I phoned him and I was like, hey, what what does this mean? He's like, well, I've been a bit like bad stuff but we saw you went to grab you. So I just took place. No, that's what he did to me as well. Yeah, it's the same thing. So I roll starts our thoughts our boss. That's a big be the big boss. Is it be how can I give a bit of context so they have to
1:  The best part about this is that you can access all of this for just $97 and you can sign up and start your assessment right now by clicking on the podcast description link. All right, let's get into the interview with dr. Berger and we hope you enjoy  Okay, welcome. Dr. David Berger. Thank you so much for joining us on mastering your fertility today. The first question that we want to ask you is just how did you get started on this path toward working in medicine and what motivated you specifically to become a pediatrician. So the story supposedly goes that when I was five years old, I declared that I was going to be a pediatrician that I told my pediatrician that and that was kind of like my life plan set up since like kindergarten. So with the exception of my
2:  Doctor feel empowered when you're in the doctor's office and make sure that you're working together on your care.  The best part about this is that you can access all of this for just $97 and you can sign up and start your assessment right now by clicking on the podcast description link. All right, let's get into the interview with dr. Berger and we hope you enjoy
3:  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview  View and the problem I have with all those interviews where they got these actual guys that like kind of like except Article 13. It's always like 10 minutes and they got two minutes to speak themselves and to respond. Maybe they got one minute. So if they ever are in a corner where they have to like say, oh my God, I'm actually deciding this because of this and that there was getting cut off. So what would be really interesting would be like a discussion where it like has no end like where they can really trapped and him so they would
4:  So much for your time, definitely. Have a great day.  All right, that's going to wrap things up for this week. Thank you so much for listening. And we hope that you found this interview with dr. Berger useful and inspiring for your own fertility journey to learn more about dr. Berger. You can find the link to his website and blog in the episode description. Also remember that this episode is brought to you by the tiny feet fertility assessment. This is an online tool where you can complete a comprehensive questionnaire and receive a personalized preconception care plan for both you and
5:  I mean this is kind of back tracking. But yeah, there was a great little interview. It was actually like one of the best things of formation wise like interview. Yeah, it was so honest with Mark and so great. So check that out if you haven't and yeah listen to it definitely it made me more excited for them. Yeah for sure. I knew was excited for me to hear that. They liked blame it on your youth those two nice because I've heard I haven't heard every episode. I know they have a big following in a lot of inside jokes and stuff. And so I feel like I like you to go back and listen to a lot more but it was cool to hear that those guys were all in.  That kind of song and yeah, so but is a great interview check it out. It's all over the Internet. Yeah.
6:  We were supposed to get a Skype interview. Okay, and then they're like decide if you want to do it and Ross was actually kind of like cheeky and it just went exceptionally anyplace me and I phoned him and I was like, hey, what what does this mean? He's like, well, I've been a bit like bad stuff but we saw you went to grab you. So I just took place. No, that's what he did to me as well. Yeah, it's the same thing. So I roll starts our thoughts our boss. That's a big be the big boss. Is it be how can I give a bit of context so they have to  Like with Captain America, they have to they have to kind of reserved you for a couple like and while they're interviewing you. So other camps car like the second day like gave you the so-called offered you think you've got a week where you're like your CVS and see what we call back home or resumes like to go offline soon us and see it. And then if you reject you can go straight back and then the like the the draft Yeah, but yes, that's what happens. We like he accepted me straight away which like I was like, well does this mean I'm no longer available to any other companies like pretty much know.
7:  It's like imagine having that just that section of this of the that song The Bridge. Yeah compared to like anything on anything or anything. Yeah or anything else on this album really come? Oh, yeah, but yeah, it's definitely one of those things like  If you listen to Dude Ranch in like in two years this band is going to make like this song it would be like what this is. I remember specifically we're like Scott run or Wagner did one of those like an interview. I think it was the Absolute Punk famous interview. Yeah, they need ID and him talking about like thinking Adam song was such a great song like the fact, you know, after years of being away from them. Yeah. That was the only one only things from the interview that really stuck out with me, but I remember hearing about that think
8:  Like he's probably I told you I heard it the night before and I was like should I even tell Michael because I was just like why are we even getting back in doing this?  I mean this is kind of back tracking. But yeah, there was a great little interview. It was actually like one of the best things of formation wise like interview. Yeah, it was so honest with Mark and so great. So check that out if you haven't and yeah listen to it definitely it made me more excited for them. Yeah for sure. I knew was excited for me to hear that. They liked blame it on your youth those two nice because I've heard I haven't heard every episode. I know they have a big following in a lot of inside jokes and stuff. And so I feel like I like you to go back and listen to a lot more but it was cool to hear that those guys were all in.
9:  So I always so I also do off camera interviews like just for my job. So there's like  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.

Yeah, and then where she's just throwing it out there where one of our favorite books that both of us have recently read is called the read aloud family by Sarah Mackenzie. So she was inspired by Jim. Yeah. It's an incredible book that we both really recommend and we'll give you a lot of insight into  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so
1:  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so  We're going to talk about why do we even need to read aloud and some benefits from it? Yeah reading aloud is a great and easy way to help your children reach their full potential. What does that mean? I will so as I was Googling it that's like on therapists and education websites like it was everywhere. Yeah, like this is a huge Foundation the principle of a way to help your child to reach their full potential. It seems so simple right? It's kind of weird that something
2:  I wouldn't because I mean it was a good movie.  All I'm going to say I'll just say a few key notes. All right, one this movie felt like movie sicker 8.5 like they're trying to some what they should have done in episode 8 with what they did in episode 9. All right, they were all over the place. Yeah. They were all over the fucking place.
3:  To if you aren't a vegetarian which I think is nice because that gives us vegetarians a little more options because I feel like a lot of the times especially like the restaurants that are highly recommended. I feel like a lot of the main dishes are I don't know protein meat based which is always sad because I want to try those dishes but I feel like they wouldn't be as good without like a substitute or something. I don't know like avocado or tofu or something. But yeah, so that's like a little overview of like  some of the more like exploring we did this weekend. It wasn't anything crazy, but it was fun to get out when it was a little bit sunnier and not super chili. Then I also read two books this weekend, which is crazy considering I didn't read very many in 2019, but I'll get to that a little later in this episode, but it was nice to sit down and read a couple good books. I read then she was gone and someone knows I can link both of them in the

It is absolutely afraid if you want to start a podcast I highly recommended. So today I wanted to do something.
6:  Went we were grappling with and what we might have needed. I think that reading picture books can be an incredibly cathartic thing to I just recommended one to a student of mine who described an experience that she had had as a child and it reminded me so much of this book and I have no idea if she has kids or not, but I was like you need to read this book like get this book for yourself. You could be young at heart, you know. Yeah, I never cared for a good picture book on that note we do something.  Which you're familiar with since you listen to some episodes called feeds and reads where I get to pick your brain and get recommendations for myself about what to read and who to follow and stuff. Yes. So to start out. Is there anything what's the best thing you've seen on social media today or this week or the last time you were on social media? Yeah, so I have been actually trying to not be on social media. It quite as much I found that it's like just so much better for myself to not be on it, but
7:  Direction so you probably know this if you're part of Dropship lifestyle, but we talked a lot about how we audit are at accounts what we're looking for how we're looking for any different signs of weakness or strength and how we're optimizing because of that so I recommended John use a tool called a ahrefs.com and basically use that to do his organic auditing so you can see where your ranking for different products you could see what your competition looks like you  Could track things over time to see if you are organic results are going up or down and make adjustments from there. So I recommended John use that tool and build a system in in his business for monitoring that I also recommended like some easy wins. And one of them was just Outsourcing pagespeed optimization. So Google and everybody really cares about how fast your site loads went once somebody lands on it. So a lot of people try to do this all themselves.
8:  Do you get experience if you don't have experience normally it's having great experiences having making bad decisions. And so you need to do first bad decisions that you will have great experience. But another thing you can do is, you know, you can read books. You can read books about other entrepreneurs. You can listen to your podcast and listen and I think this is something that helps.  Listen and read a lot of podcasts and entrepreneur books and then you start with a single project and you try to to to start with an MVP and start directly with marketing and talk to people and if you see that people have something in their eyes and they're like, oh, this is a cool thing then you're on to something. But if you need to explain if you need to
9:  With it. But again, what do you got to lose but eating healthy but one day I was at the chiropractor and I heard this woman who had been in the hospital for four like on and off for weeks and she was pretty young probably in her forties maybe early 50s and she was explaining how sick she'd been to this the receptionist and I couldn't help but hear it. I was 2 feet away. So when I was done I said hey if you have you tried, you know celery  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and
 
Topic 54 bias in college admissions: I read an article that mentioned a podcast about bias in college admissions.  I would like to listen to it but I don’t know the name of the show.
0:  Daughter and I don't understand I know the college experience because that was one of her excuses. Like I'm just here for the experience. You know, I just wanted I'll go to football games and she was when she mentioned class she was like, I don't really care about it. Yeah. I saw that man to you. She is a Creator on YouTube. So yes, I can in principle be getting Bank.  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.
1:  This is facing up to 55 0 years in prison for the College admission Scandal and honestly hilarious, it's hilarious to me but ridiculous like why dude no phones.  Why is that being punished so harshly?
2:  But I definitely always tried to make sure I was seeing at least one of my friends every single week and it absolutely changed my mental and emotional health being able to have that time with a friend and spend time with them and just talk to them and not really be worried about school and just having that sort of like fellowship and a sense is just so important and I think I've mentioned this before and I think I mentioned in the last podcast but you know a lot of times in college. I've kind of just compared my  College life and my college situation and you know like my friends to a lot of people that I see on social media who have you know, they have like a big group message or big group me with like 20 other roles in it. And you know, they always have someone that they could be doing something with like no matter what time of day it is and you know always have someone to hang out with are always doing something every night or every weekend and I catch myself comparing myself to those people a lot of times, but I've realized that
3:  been alleged to have paid college-prep Man William Rick Singer who according to CNN has been paid up to 25 million dollars total by different parents. Not just these two ridiculous people, but other people too, okay to ensure that their kids look their best to gain College admissions to prestigious schools. Now, I know I have a lot of listeners in different countries. So I want to say this. I know no matter where you are money talks. And so it might not seem like a big deal to get let into a school because your parents pay  More or can pay more but let's talk about this scheme specific. Now the way that these parents were going about making their kids look better is paying people to actually sit for their college admissions exams things like the SATs, which is something that we take here in order for students to be able to be let in to colleges you have to score at a certain level for certain schools. So they had people sitting up there taking the test for them and according to the story. These were higher scores than these kids could have probably ever dreamed of ever.
4:  So it's I don't know. It's it's College like it's so trust me as a person who who's in college and me and you both it's the admission process is difficult. Yeah. So now seeing these people like getting in like for free piss you off does it pisses me off? Oh, yeah. I'm not necessarily. It's just like really pissed me off, you know, but I can imagine someone who like is studying their ass off to get into Yale. You know, it's like come on, dude.  And is the thing that specifically about this girl was the college experience like come on my you can have a college experience and not go to college. Yeah. I remember people criticize her for that because like you were like, why are you being so ungrateful? Like this is an opportunity. This is a blessing you're into a great College. Like why are you being so great for then? She apologized obviously people are gonna forget. Apparently. She apologized. Yeah, but I mean now when people know how she got it apparently, you know, Mom push her she may be grass out. That's how we do.
5:  You're like I want to talk about this powerful woman who I don't know then every now and then it brought us to making that a topic. And what was I talking about before that like nothing nothing. That's usually what I go on about. Well speaking of a not so powerful woman Lori Loughlin Lachlan, Lori. Ha ha ha ha from Full House.  This is facing up to 55 0 years in prison for the College admission Scandal and honestly hilarious, it's hilarious to me but ridiculous like why dude no phones.
6:  Yeah, what can you can you send me that article when I get off and I love to take a peek at yeah. Yeah, for sure. And for those of you that are listening that want to learn more about this too. I encourage you to jump on LinkedIn if you're on there, if you're a business professional on LinkedIn my page on there is exactly like the podcast it's junior golf keys, and I'm just posting articles just like this that hopefully can help you guys with learning about different aspects of developing young players. And so the article like I said is called wide.  Junior golfers should continue playing multiple Sports and yeah, I'll definitely send it to you that when we wrap up. That's awesome touched on it but being a younger coach and I've only really I've been coaching college golf now for five years and a lot of coaches I go against I've been coaching for you know, 20 30 heck 40 years even in their sixties. And so what I may lack in experience, I mean, this is all I do is, you know, listen these podcasts and read three books and read articles and is trying to absorb as much info as I can, you know, obviously my body is young, but I try to get my
7:  Less naive no because I don't I don't like that idea of people just thinking oh you read one article and you know your stuff like I read very little articles, but I also don't say I know everything at all, but I know someone who reads like maybe like one and key thing here Forbes article or something like that or like a Twitter article or something like, you know, those those articles you see on Facebook. Sorry, I'm old. So I still use Facebook apparently.  So those articles you see on Facebook. I just like oh my gosh, someone did this to someone and you read an article on its complete BS. I mean, it's probably BS but it's just I'd rather be someone informed with the right thing or like actually not even informed at all. Then being informed my one-sided media Yeah by one side of the media exactly know it and it's true because again, I was gonna ask this question before
8:  Mind in mindset focused on like getting into the Harvard or getting into that crazy good school that elevates a school status to yeah, which is interesting because let's say you have you don't have the grades, but maybe you want to apply to a school and like just to see a lot of our College people say no don't apply just because it reflects poorly on the college admissions program and I find that really interesting too. Oh, I would say that that's  Example, I'm hitting coach me to go to a specific School of my parents. Didn't know my dad is from was from Cuba. My mom from Columbia came over not knowing much about what even colleges were. So I didn't I didn't go to college right away. So I graduated in 2006 in 2006. That was the first time that I realized that my parents needed to have like immigrant like paperwork to be so that I can go to so to college I end up going to Miami Dade College.
9:  Are you all that is priceless and I think that you know having a really great core support system is very very important to you know, how you are mentally and emotionally and how you take care of yourself. I think this year. I really made an effort to prioritize spending my time with my friends at school at least once a week like each one of them. I feel like I saw at least once a week and like, of course there were times where I didn't see them for two or three weeks.  But I definitely always tried to make sure I was seeing at least one of my friends every single week and it absolutely changed my mental and emotional health being able to have that time with a friend and spend time with them and just talk to them and not really be worried about school and just having that sort of like fellowship and a sense is just so important and I think I've mentioned this before and I think I mentioned in the last podcast but you know a lot of times in college. I've kind of just compared my
 
Topic 55 malcolm x biography: I heard about a podcast biography of Malcolm X and I would like to listen to it.
0: Are we really free? Hell? No. No, we're not well.  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.
1:  Back in the day when Malcolm X was still living he wanted to bring the us up on charges of crimes against humanity. And when you listen to what Malcolm X says it is amazing.  Of how everything he said back then still resonate to this very day. So how far do we really go?
2:  You will find out in 2020.  but Malcolm X
3:  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.  But the society is so rigged up.
4:  People like that. Don't get awarded.  People like that do not get propped up unless the black community do the propping like we did for Malcolm X.
5:  but Malcolm X  I believe was a very courageous man. He really puts so much of himself on the line for the black community and people like that are always under appreciated.
6:  Ain't got no real problem.  For me, I understand that when I look at my ancestors, like challenges and pressure is why we say Martin Luther King because he went through them. It's why we say Malcolm X because we say Rosa Parks or Harriet Tubman why because of the challenges that they went through and I got through it. So listen to me the first part of a diamond is pressure. The pressure is what destroys all up.
7:  That was going on in the country then as well as now.  So I'm going to go ahead and play this audio so you can hear exactly what Malcolm X was saying about bringing the u.s. To the United Nations.
8:  In controlled person should get sedated so that they can then get some therapy and come off gradually, okay and medication. So then after that you mentioned getting into Muslim is well, I embraced Islam. Yeah. Well, so I saw the movie Malcolm X part of the definitely part of like the experience like of what I went through was all I guess pieces to making me look at my life and kind of ask some simple questions.  I don't know. I just got tired of not being in control of myself and I got tired of seeing for me. It was never really about like religion that was never a religious person. Actually, I was very adverse to religion wasn't into it. And I made fun of it. My grandmother always told me about you know, yeah, there's a Creator you should do the right thing. It was basic, you know golden rules sure that she would instill in me. I saw the movie Malcolm X when I was already really really just kind of coming out of my jacked-up face and I saw that he
9:  It makes sense and is at that moment that I saw to look at these books that he gave me and the first the first book I read was Malcolm X right the autobiography. So I read because before that we was reading like Donald goines and Iceberg Slim was re no other show. So now I'm like, let me read some real shit. So I read Malcolm X and then second book. I read was a people's history by Howard Zinn right was talked about Columbus and all that shit and shit blew my mind. I was like this motherfucker was a criminal. Yeah.  Right. I'm in here and I'm here is my fucking slow to the whole nation of people and so and then from there was like black economics are conspiracy to destroy black boys volume is 1 2 and 3 and these are the books that he gave us. So now my mom was open. I'm like, oh shit. This shit is real and and it is at that point that I start to realize what happened to us how we got Bamboozled and how the system did his dirty and is at the point that I say. I'm a different man, right?
 
Topic 56 gaslighting: On Twitter I saw someone reference a podcast interview with a doctor about gaslighting within organizational systems and I would like to hear it.
0:  What I'm talking about today is not gaslighting in the conscious manipulative sense. But again, the effect can be similar to the impact gaslighting has on eroding Trust.  Ideas are a dime a dozen people who Implement them are Priceless and anchor helps me Implement my ideas and makes it simple.

1:  Jay called gas light which was about a woman whose husband slowly manipulates her into believing that she's going insane. I've never seen the movie, but it's on my must see someday list.  What I'm talking about today is not gaslighting in the conscious manipulative sense. But again, the effect can be similar to the impact gaslighting has on eroding Trust.
2:  In a way we can describe it as gaslighting with positive intentions. They learn to question their own reality and in turn to mistrust themselves, it erodes their self-esteem. I know that's kind of hard to hear just sit with that for a second. We've most likely all done it in one way or another.  Many adults have learned to do this from their own experiences with this as children when their parents.
3:  We post it up on the Instagram and those will follow that was just asking me like, why did we ask the girl what her intention was and we she would like to see that that girl added into the conversation and I was just like I saw the because obviously like I don't she didn't realize that like I saw it from Twitter and I saw it literally unfold like on Twitter and I go got so much hate and I sold like am I saw the intention? I was like I  I saw it I understood it, but and I'm not hating on the girl. I just said that it's the opinion itself that made me really upset me that very clear and lost time and I continue I continue to make it clear and she just felt like I was like it was pointless. So anyway, I didn't think it was pointless. I wasn't being a hater. I was really just talking about that as a discussion just to say look, like people are still thinking like that and we need to continue.
4:  Now lying is often intentional and the distinction here is that this is generally not conscious or with the intent to deceive yet. It can have a similar impact on eroding Trust.  You've probably heard the term gaslighting by now because that's another buzzword thats everywhere of late gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where the manipulator is trying to cause the other person to question their own reality or their memory or their perceptions. The term comes from the 1944 American Psychological Thriller film adapted from Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play.
5:  Invalidating yet until we bring all these all these people. I mean then the like the concept of privilege was brought up and you knowing so my all of us are privileged even I just waited this last week, but let's hold that because I won the special guest to come. Yeah, we need another episode but yes, I thought like it was invalidating everyone that all the other brand men in all the other industries that were really working hard to make a name for Pacific Islanders and  We post it up on the Instagram and those will follow that was just asking me like, why did we ask the girl what her intention was and we she would like to see that that girl added into the conversation and I was just like I saw the because obviously like I don't she didn't realize that like I saw it from Twitter and I saw it literally unfold like on Twitter and I go got so much hate and I sold like am I saw the intention? I was like I
6:  You've probably heard the term gaslighting by now because that's another buzzword thats everywhere of late gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where the manipulator is trying to cause the other person to question their own reality or their memory or their perceptions. The term comes from the 1944 American Psychological Thriller film adapted from Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play.  Jay called gas light which was about a woman whose husband slowly manipulates her into believing that she's going insane. I've never seen the movie, but it's on my must see someday list.
7:  Look I get it. Our instinct is to protect our kids to Shield them from pain or negative emotions and the reality of the difficulties in life, but inadvertently and out of Good Intentions what this does is teach our kids to mistrust themselves.  In a way we can describe it as gaslighting with positive intentions. They learn to question their own reality and in turn to mistrust themselves, it erodes their self-esteem. I know that's kind of hard to hear just sit with that for a second. We've most likely all done it in one way or another.
8:  So something else I wanted to talk about that when this happened. I was like, oh my God, I can't wait to talk about that on my podcast is I'm sure if you're on Twitter, you saw the Ayesha Curry red tabletalk or it was with their whole family, but people were really focusing in on like what she was saying and if you haven't watched it basically Jada, I'm like her fan sit-down with Asia and like her fan and they're talking about being like the why  Ives to these star athletes and like how about affects them and they talk about having anxiety and it was actually like a really good episode. Like I don't know it was just it was very relatable even though like it wasn't it was and I should basically talks about how she like they're talking about how they deal with their husbands getting all this attention from women and if they get jealous and
9:  Girl was like she's always been a girl. Yeah, she was like, oh I transferred. I mean trans women have always been grossly. But yeah, you know that she's always been this girl and she was like, yeah I transition on a very young age, which is not realistic. It's not because it's you can give you what you can do is go but like you're not transitioning to the point where you're getting like, you know, like reproductive systems like a doctor's not operating on any  Below the age of 18 are just not. Yeah. Well, I think I'll be 16 in some policy with like parental consent or what? Yeah, but like man like a dog like at a very young age because I think she started modeling I like
 
Topic 57 nefertiti: I want to hear a podcast I know about that is about Nefertiti.
0:  We know about Nefertiti was his public Queen and her children would have had the main claim to the throne Nefertiti and her husband's rain was noteworthy in two main ways. The first was the religious Revolution. They had instigated in the early years of their rule ancient Egypt was polytheistic the people worshipped numerous Gods under the grand rule of Amun the king god of the Egyptian Pantheon, but amenhotep the  a fourth and Nefertiti fought to do away with all polytheistic practice in favor of monotheistic worship of a single God the son Otten. I Minho tapes Devotion to his new religion was so great that he even changed his name from amenhotep the fourth to Akhenaten which is what he is still commonly known as among egyptology suggests the name translates to effective for auton.
1:  As Queen Nefertiti held the title of great Royal wife to Pharaoh amenhotep the fourth. This means she was his chief consort ancient Egyptian Society was polygamist, especially among the royal family of pharaoh might have numerous wives and even more Mistresses and concubines, but they only had one great Royal wife while amenhotep the fourth had at least three other wives that  We know about Nefertiti was his public Queen and her children would have had the main claim to the throne Nefertiti and her husband's rain was noteworthy in two main ways. The first was the religious Revolution. They had instigated in the early years of their rule ancient Egypt was polytheistic the people worshipped numerous Gods under the grand rule of Amun the king god of the Egyptian Pantheon, but amenhotep the
2:  Became the queen it seems that someone would have written it down. So if Nefertiti isn't the younger lady then who is she or for the sake of this podcast? Where is she even if she's not Tutankhamun's mother the secret to her tomb may be tied to him. Our next theory is one that only came up in the last 10 years. It states that Nefertiti is in KV 62 the tumor.  Common was discovered in a hidden room. But if Nefertiti wasn't actually Tutankhamun's mother then why would she be buried with him and not with Akhenaten in KV? 55? Well, you know the feeling when your neighbor has a nicer to me than yours and you think you might want it for yourself. It might have something to do with that. You likely don't need us to tell you that Tutankhamun is the single most famous mummy ever to be discovered in the remnants of ancient.
3:  Nefertiti's likeness occupies Museum gift shops the world over and the queen herself has become one of the most well-known historical Egyptians rivaled and fame only by King Tutankhamun himself and yet for over a hundred years archaeologists have failed to identify Nefertiti's remains. Where is Nefertiti is her tomb truly hidden, or have we found?  Found her and just don't know it.
4:  No reason no point. If you want to listen to a political podcast, you know where to go. And so just in my own life, I subscribe to Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro. And if I if I want to hear something from the right point of view, I'll listen to Ben Shapiro. And if I want to hear something from the left, I'll listen to Sam Harris. And those are the two political podcast subscribe to but I  Don't go to Ben Greenfield or to Dave asprey looking for political commentary. So there's an example.
5:  Because you have got it within you to be able to do whatever it is that you want to do with your life and these women and these stories that will be shared on this podcast. Will hopefully be relatable to you and you will see that these women are not so different from yourself and that if they can do it then you can too.  And I honestly have so much more that I want to share with you right now. But I also just really want to get stuck into these interviews and these chats with these amazing amazing woman and I would absolutely love to hear from you guys in terms of the types of things that you want to hear on the podcast and the people that you would like to hear interviewed. There is a place on the website. If you got a business build hers.com forward slash podcast, there is actually a link for you to nominate people. So if you know of somebody who's inspiring
6:  Into an episode about biohacking and that's fine. That's fantastic little something for everyone. One thing I will not discuss politics will not get into politics just waste of time.  No reason no point. If you want to listen to a political podcast, you know where to go. And so just in my own life, I subscribe to Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro. And if I if I want to hear something from the right point of view, I'll listen to Ben Shapiro. And if I want to hear something from the left, I'll listen to Sam Harris. And those are the two political podcast subscribe to but I
7:  So that sounds good to you. Go to Anchor dot f m / start. That's anchor dot f m / start join me and a diverse community of people who are already podcasting on anchor. I can't wait to see what you podcast bam. Let me hear it. Okay? Okay. Can you can you do that? Just do it, please. I want to I want to hear your stories and experiences. Come on.  I want to hear your podcast about your grandma. I'm not into Grandma's but I mean I bet she's a nice lady. Alright guys. Peace.
8:  As we've said Nefertiti is an extremely likely candidate for never never wotton given that Nefertiti is known to have changed her name to never-never wotton Nefertiti during her husband's rain, but the connection between these two can't be confirmed without a body and never never wattens body has never been found the main piece of evidence that links Nefertiti and the short-lived female.  Rho is the co-regency Stella which features a likeness of Nefertiti Nefertiti's name was replaced with the name on Kappa Rory. Never never Watson. This would fall in line with the theory that Akhenaten promoted Nefertiti to the position of co-regent and that Nefertiti changed her official title. After that Ascension after Akhenaten died Nefertiti continued to rule for a short time until
9:  Out the possibility that Nefertiti is buried in King Tut's tomb.

Topic 58 sam bush interview: A bluegrass magazine I read mentioned a podcast interview with Sam Bush.  I’d like to hear it.
0: Hey guys, welcome to another episode of the real economy show and this is a very different kind of episode because today it's not interview kind of thing. But right now I'm with a person whom a lot of you know, and with digital fatigue and like this is a super interesting fact this podcast interview took me actually one year  Ear and three months like yeah like more than one year like that's how this person is to get a podcast interview with. So, so anyways right now we are doing this episode because it's my last day with digital pratik like because of some reasons. I will not be continuing with this brand or digital product. So we decided to just shoot this podcast episode and just talk and like I hope you guys
1:  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.  Really does sound like you both. It was really the sort of like almost instant creative coming together and weird ways I happen to be for is that like was that unusual? So it's I mean, I'm done one moving of them one television show outside of this. So my experience is limited, but the fact that she and I hit it off so quickly so early is practically unheard of I mean, the first thing we do is like oh, yeah, we all know each other's names.
2:  You also have your own podcast, which I listen to all the time. Um, why don't you talk a little bit about that? So my podcast is called the real real and it's kind of like a play on words because the last real spelled r ee L like a highlight reel a reel of film. So what I thought when I was starting it was I want to start a podcast where I interview people and I didn't only want to interview super successful people. I didn't only want to  Interview like women I didn't only want to interview my friends. Like I wanted to interview a ton of people in different walks of life and I wanted it to be very very real sense the title but very much like not. Oh, how did you become super successful? I wanted it to be like, what are the real struggles of getting to where you are or you might not be where you want to be yet. But what are you doing to get there? Like I interview so many of my friends and different jobs that don't often get highlighted like my
3:  That it looks and in the on the show notes, well technically in the show notes, but after after his interview he gave like shoutouts to people who have four views of the podcast and you mentioned my name and I was like, oh my God, I was just mentioned in the same like in the same interview as Ryan brown eyes are like this fantastic Ryan's going to have to listen to this episode and then he's going to have to hear about my review and then he's gonna know who I am like this the most exciting day of my life. I was so excited. So I think the day that I got him on the podcast. That's probably one of my worst episodes.  Because I was so excited to talk to him and I had so many questions that it was like this is gonna be a four-hour long podcast and he had just had his child like a few months before I know but I can't oh and he had like a problem is their pods. He was gonna do that. This was like right after the are pods came out. So like he was trying to get him to work with his Mac, but I guess at the time there was some sort of like driver to make it work or some sort of like extra software and he couldn't get it. So to start off the interview, he was already like really upset and I was like, so how did you get into photography?
4:  It's Series on Amazon homecoming starring Julia Roberts, which was nominated for three Golden Globe awards. Although it didn't win any of them. Now people familiar with me or gimlet the company. I co-founded which makes this podcast that you're listening to right now and many others you might remember homecoming began its life as a gimlet podcast and gimlet was very involved in the making of that show. In fact, I did a whole series of Stories on turning the homecoming podcast into the homecoming TV show.  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.
5:  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's
6:  three hours might be two and a half hours. It might be an hour. But rarely, will you hear Sam Harris or Joe Rogan? Say Okay hours up our time limit sup, I mean, they just let it go until it organically dies. And I think that's the way that that a podcast is meant to be. So no time limit again. I'm not a fan of that.  Also in this is one that's that's I don't want to say controversial but you know different people have different viewpoints. We are not going to edit the podcast we will not edit. So if we're live with a QA or we have an interview, we're just going to keep going to examples there so Sam Harris he edits his podcast and and he, you know allows his guests to go back and redact and we'll wait a second, you know, let me edit that out and so on and so forth.
7:  Yes, I had like four beers in me, which I just I don't typically do anyway, so yeah, I really love every every episode but if I'm if I have to think of like some of the people who I never thought that I'd be able to talk to. Yeah. So I remember a few years ago. One of my favorite podcast is the photo is exposed podcast with Andrew hellmich, and he did an episode with Ryan Braun iser. And at the time I just totally idolized that dude. I'm I still think brown eyes are is that every weddings? I just love the way  That it looks and in the on the show notes, well technically in the show notes, but after after his interview he gave like shoutouts to people who have four views of the podcast and you mentioned my name and I was like, oh my God, I was just mentioned in the same like in the same interview as Ryan brown eyes are like this fantastic Ryan's going to have to listen to this episode and then he's going to have to hear about my review and then he's gonna know who I am like this the most exciting day of my life. I was so excited. So I think the day that I got him on the podcast. That's probably one of my worst episodes.
8:  I've always wanted to have a store in one to be in a business owner and one day I was like, okay, I'm just gonna do it. So and you're doing it and it's yeah close. I love the website. I love everything Q. Thank you.  You also have your own podcast, which I listen to all the time. Um, why don't you talk a little bit about that? So my podcast is called the real real and it's kind of like a play on words because the last real spelled r ee L like a highlight reel a reel of film. So what I thought when I was starting it was I want to start a podcast where I interview people and I didn't only want to interview super successful people. I didn't only want to
