0:  I don't like those guys. Those guys are my boys, but I cannot believe we have this Darth Vader guy in the fucking white house. When I say Darth Vader, I'm not saying I'm against him or I'm for him. But you have to admit we got a guy that's living in the 80s being the president in this fucking thing. You know what I mean? He's talking to the Ukrainian president. I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened. I'm gonna go touch with Jen tell him what happened you pretend you're the random rancid polisher.  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.
1:  so he's going after Biden. So he's basically telling the Ukrainian president. You'll give me shit on bite in and if you give me shit on bite and I'll give you fucking money. So that's like some fugged out gangster shit. You can't do that. Right? So the difference between the molar report which was going on for the last three or four years when they're trying to take him down and the difference between this is they actually got a taped conversation or they got some some messages. So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.
2:  Sure. Okay. So tell me what have just talked about it. My understanding is in a conversation with the Ukrainian president. He made comments. He's alleged to a make comments. Like we want to investigate this thing about Biden's son and etcetera like that. Yeah, Joe Biden son right there trying to get dirt on them. Right? And so basically Donald Trump, that was great bill. You did really good. Well, thank you. Great now just stand here, basically.  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos? What the fuck's going on that damn, right? I don't want to see that. So he's trying to get dirt on Joe Biden because in Donald Trump sighs Joe Biden is the only one that he thinks kid what the beat him can beat him. Yeah, you know that the angle is he's not trying to get dirt on Elizabeth Warren, right? He thinks Bernie Sanders is fucking gone. He just thinks
3:  Donald Trump is talking to the Ukrainian president. Basically saying give me dirt on Joe Biden's son. What did Joe Biden do porn? Like? What did he use the black dildos?

So it's proof that they that he actually set this and you legally can't say that
4:  Audio tapes, but after the backlash he'd faced for the Saturday night Massacre. He knew that he couldn't simply ignore the subpoenas on May 1st. The White House released 1254 pages of edited transcripts of the recorded conversations. The White House is summary of the documents argued that they would put an end to the accusation since quote in all of the thousands of words spoken even though they often are unclear  And ambiguous not once does it appear that the president of the United States was engaged in a criminal plot to obstruct justice. But if the White House had truly believed this would remove the Shroud over Nixon's presidency. They were sorely mistaken rather than proving his innocence. The edited transcripts raised new questions about Watergate at one point Nixon discussed the prospect of raising a million dollars for a hush money.
5:  Right, you can't do that. And guess what Donald Trump supporters say with the information they say what they still don't believe it's fake news. Right man. That shit is fake newsman know what he's talking about. That's your bullshit. You not talking about Ukrainian president. You know what I mean? Right? I mean, it's just crazy and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing. Is that CNN as you guys know, you're very much well aware of and MSN. They fucking hate Donald Trump.  They just shit on them. I mean they you know, Don Lemon is a homosexual man as we know Anderson Cooper is a homosexual man as we as we know but when they're performing and they're doing they're they're speaking as a broadcasters. They don't act what they don't act gay. They don't act gay of course. No, they act what very well straight and to the point. Yeah, but when they start to reporting on Donald Trump and they're getting pissed off to start know what well they start getting wild now they start acting what olestra
6:  I don't know what it is. But when I come home late at night around and you guys are welcome to try man, you know, if you're engaged you're not engaged and don't chime in. I don't know what's on your mind. But when I come home late at night around 10 11 12 o'clock. I'm more interested in watching. What the fuck is going on in the political world with our president that I am say, for instance the new Dave Chappelle Bill Burr comedy stand-up on Netflix not  I don't like those guys. Those guys are my boys, but I cannot believe we have this Darth Vader guy in the fucking white house. When I say Darth Vader, I'm not saying I'm against him or I'm for him. But you have to admit we got a guy that's living in the 80s being the president in this fucking thing. You know what I mean? He's talking to the Ukrainian president. I don't know if you guys know that do you know what happened? I heard that show them what happened stand up and tell him what happened. I'm gonna go touch with Jen tell him what happened you pretend you're the random rancid polisher.
7:  He's getting a week. No crazy. Okay, right. He's gonna what tweet out. What? Oh, wow. Yeah wild shit. So Jen you can actually save the world can't I would you have sex and blow our President Donald Trump if he promises to just chill the fuck out and stop speaking ukrainians and stop breaking the law and just fucking run the country. Would you do that? I would suck his dick for a lot. Like what what what  What what should I would suck his dick for a lot less? But yes, Jesus Christ Bill, you might have an action tonight. Oh very cool. And remember you guys I was telling you about my friend Jimmy with the black dildo.
8:  Porn business Stormy Daniels Stormy Daniels who else probably others that I can't speak on don't know probably others. He was also having sex with Playmates Karen McDougal and guess what happened when he became president. Oh shut up this morning. They took they took the vagina away from him. And if they if you take the vagina if they if they take the vagina away from him. What's it going to make him do  He's getting a week. No crazy. Okay, right. He's gonna what tweet out. What? Oh, wow. Yeah wild shit. So Jen you can actually save the world can't I would you have sex and blow our President Donald Trump if he promises to just chill the fuck out and stop speaking ukrainians and stop breaking the law and just fucking run the country. Would you do that? I would suck his dick for a lot. Like what what what
9:  Is of the phrase expletive deleted that it became a national joke. The only thing the transcripts didn't show was any concern about the country's best interest, but while the contents of the transcripts were incredibly damaging what wasn't in them was possibly even more troubling an 18 and a half minutes section of a conversation between Nixon and Haldeman from the Monday after the break-in was blank when asked about the  Missing section white house chief of staff Alexander Haig said he feared that it had been erased by some Sinister Force unsurprisingly many Americans jumped to the conclusion that the Sinister Force responsible for the scrubbed conversation was Nixon himself. The implication was damning. Whatever was said in those 18 and a half minutes had to be more damaging than anything the White House had already released.
 
Topic 10 boeing 737 crash causes: The Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliner was grounded worldwide after hundreds of people died in two crashes in 2019.  What were people saying about the airline and the company?  What were speculated causes of the crash?  What did people think the effect would be on Boeing’s reputation?  News is relevant, but so is speculation.
[2900, 4365, 5662, 4364, 2899, 4366, 4363, 2792, 2793, 5663]
0:  I have the exact details around the Kobe Bryant crash helicopter crash, right? So I apologize for that. We have nothing but the utmost respect and just our hearts are so broken. It seems to just get worse and worse that the other people on board, you know, there were six nine total victims and six other people including Kobe and his  is his incredible daughter as well as a baseball coach named John out to Bellow his wife one of their daughters a woman who Christina Mauser who was an assistant basketball coach a woman named Sarah trust her and her daughter. So I mean, it just makes me wanna cry it just gets worse and worse. As you know, that the podcast wasn't specifically about that about the crash. We it was more of a
1:  I'm aware of we can't time it because we don't know when it's going to happen. We'll all we can do is just, you know be aware of it and kind of protect ourselves against what the repercussions of that are. So I think when the financial crash of 2008 occurred a lot of people were caught off guard because they were over leveraging. I don't want to call them assets but liabilities that you know specific to housing.  You were being lended outside of their ability to pay it back. So of course in a lot of people lost their houses because they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage. So I think you know understanding where we are in terms of the market is important and understanding that, you know, certainly at some point then I think some people are saying the end of this year or the end of next year.
2:  What do you guys think of Tom DeLonge? I think it's a little out there but he's obviously working with some really big people and but I feel like he's making a lot of promises that he won't be able to keep like I feel like he's talking a lot about like that plane and stuff like that. He wants to build the like, how long do we have to wait like 20 years? Like I know he is doing all this is pocket but like spacecraft is talking about Bill. Yeah, they're saying they have the technology now and it's because of a crash that they had of some aliens.  In 58, not 57 in Roswell rather, but in 58 there was a crash and apparently there was some you know.
3:  Practice of its you know, it's going to go back to you know, what is homeostasis, I guess and then or beyond that right it's going to bounce back into what people refer to as a crash and then it's going to start coming back. So I think people who understand investing especially long-term investing in the stock market or even in real estate understand that you know, there's there's going to be a good one and then there's going to be a bad run you just kind of have to prepare for that. It's definitely something that I'm  I'm aware of we can't time it because we don't know when it's going to happen. We'll all we can do is just, you know be aware of it and kind of protect ourselves against what the repercussions of that are. So I think when the financial crash of 2008 occurred a lot of people were caught off guard because they were over leveraging. I don't want to call them assets but liabilities that you know specific to housing.
4:  Really the perfect way to kick off this podcast and really gives you an understanding of where I hoped to go with it. So I hope it was really interesting for you and you felt connected to what we talked about or gained some new insights around it, and I wanted to apologize that when we recorded it. It was first thing on Monday morning and neither Nina.  I have the exact details around the Kobe Bryant crash helicopter crash, right? So I apologize for that. We have nothing but the utmost respect and just our hearts are so broken. It seems to just get worse and worse that the other people on board, you know, there were six nine total victims and six other people including Kobe and his
5:  You were being lended outside of their ability to pay it back. So of course in a lot of people lost their houses because they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage. So I think you know understanding where we are in terms of the market is important and understanding that, you know, certainly at some point then I think some people are saying the end of this year or the end of next year.  Who's going to be a crash and you know politics plays a big role, you know, we have trade Wars going on. We have, you know, a new election getting ready to come. There's a lot of factors that influence what the economy looks like, but at the root of and that's why I think it's so important to to address the the relationship with money from a spiritual and mental perspective there either.
6:  So there's definitely concerned with in Financial Services of the whole and certainly people who are involved in you know, the various kind of investing strategies, whether it be the stock market or you know, real estate market, you know, it's an inevitability write it down markers. Don't crash they correct and so it's very cyclical. You're gonna you go very far in One Direction and then the markets  Practice of its you know, it's going to go back to you know, what is homeostasis, I guess and then or beyond that right it's going to bounce back into what people refer to as a crash and then it's going to start coming back. So I think people who understand investing especially long-term investing in the stock market or even in real estate understand that you know, there's there's going to be a good one and then there's going to be a bad run you just kind of have to prepare for that. It's definitely something that I'm
7:  A plane crashes in the world. He definitely triggers that for him. Yeah, you know and so if we all have our greatest fear and most of them are irrational and a lot of them are around a member of our family dying so watching this tragedy is super can be really bringing up a lot of negative thought patterns and then it's the separation of like, how can I  grieve, how can I honor this person and their life and life in general but also not make it about me right like disaster Junkies, you know, and I like to think that people have the best intentions usually but I you know, I just remember specifically this boy in my high school and he he was in a car crash and he the best friend was driving and they hit a tree and he
8:  grieve, how can I honor this person and their life and life in general but also not make it about me right like disaster Junkies, you know, and I like to think that people have the best intentions usually but I you know, I just remember specifically this boy in my high school and he he was in a car crash and he the best friend was driving and they hit a tree and he  Died I was actually supposed to be in the car funny enough not funny, but we were supposed to go to a basketball game with them and we didn't and I didn't know him like really at all or the girl driving my friends. Like let's go to the basketball game. And so they died and you know, he dies. She doesn't die the driver and
9:  In 58, not 57 in Roswell rather, but in 58 there was a crash and apparently there was some you know.  Just metal that has never been on this planet before that. They can charge with like photons and shooting different shit at it and it charges up and then it's lighter than air something doesn't it doesn't yeah, that's that's where he loses me because a lot of people that lie try to expand the the description of things to the point where it son.
 
Topic 11 how to cook turkey: I’m looking for podcasts that talk about how to cook turkey well, in particular podcasts that have some information on how I can make my turkey juicier.

0:  it's almost like it looks like like hard bread or but that's really thin sheets of it, but it's like a pasta more. So it's more like a bad past your texture when it's cooked and you break it up. You crunch break it up into pieces. Yeah, and you boil it for a few minutes with salt then you drain it and then here's where it gets its flavor. And this is so bad.

Topic 12 imran khan career: Imran Khan is the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, and had a career as an international cricket star.  What have people said about his career and achievements?
[302, 303, 3340, 3339, 72, 4051, 73, 71, 4060, 4059]
0:  Prime Minister of Pakistan like about the 1992 World Cups just dinner right? He's unlocked some doors. He's full value on Twitter though. Like I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but he he's not afraid slate opinion most recently about Shahid Afridi decision to the band his daughters from playing Cricket. Yeah, that's quite a lot of trolling or shared freely going on there. That's an area we  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.
1:  Go into evidence. I've got my opinion and I think Jade freed is an idiot, but I definitely concur but just got into it. Haven't you he's lied about his age his opinion on with his wrong previous World Cup performance. They are one of the teams were played all 11 World Cups how many times they won it twice denied. They're going at once they'd be England in the final night 92 in Australia when they were captained by it their current prime minister Imran Khan.  Um, so that's a little bit of the back story of the great creaking nation of Pakistan. I think you are everyone should be Brewing Pakistan. It would make their day if they want the bulk up. Yeah, there's not being international cricket played there for a number of years because security reasons, they finally get back to that position where actually the safety in their main cities is good. Yep, and they want people to come back and play like it's huge thing is over. I love Pakistani. Yeah. I mean I think offering them they're my favorite team in the tournament as do you say
2:  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.  In being part of the global Endeavor, we will have a situation where they could be more like a horse you were talking about a small D's reports are not very encouraging. It's apparently one of the nation's from where large number of people have gone and join the Islamic State their comeback. Now these attacks in Sri Lanka you're referring to reports in the media elsewhere about how there is an interconnected or there are some traces of connection. So to say between India and these people who have carried out these strikes now once you know, I make an ism like this comes
3:  Those steps my senses that Masood Azhar may be treated with the same kind of indulgence. But Pakistan would have to demonstrate its own quote unquote good faith in relation to the financial action task force. So while it would be desirable to have a country like Pakistan supporting this kind of an Endeavor in a very very sincere way. The reality is that Pakistan's own internal patterns preferences choices both political and otherwise are inhibiting meaningful cooperation because they are also aware that  In a country like Pakistan, there is prime minister Imran Khan, who is the civilian prime minister in Islamabad? There is a Pakistani army Chief with the GHQ which is operating from Rawalpindi. There are groups like The lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed that of operating out of a place called Marine K. Now. These are the kind of I would say power structures in their own way that are supporting or enabling terrorism. So unless countries like Pakistan are not brought on both politically meaning that they have to demonstrate their sincerity.
4:  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in
5:  Of the great spells of bowling. I mean India or otherwise, I mean Malcolm Marshall how it doesn't get better than that, right? Who wants to go next? Visit Vijay? Yes it hello everyone. This is Vijay are moving from Sydney. I'm going to pick Roger Binny from 1987 the second test match between India and Pakistan. So Imran Khan's Pakistan visited India for a five test series against couple days Indians. This was before  The Reliance cup so this happened in the January February timeframe of 1987 after the high scoring draw in the first test match and Madras 1987 the Caravan moved to Eden Gardens Calcutta back, then it was Calcutta still and Sunil gavaskar refused to play at the Eden Gardens citing the crowd trouble that happened in the 8485 test match against England and Imran Khan having won the toss put India in thinking. Okay. There is no Galveston. Let me get some early wickets.
6:  And I went down towards the dressing room. It was locked and the one they said you go up in the ninjas of the ice break-up than similar. You know, I have to work to do any question any chance of thunder. Meanwhile The Spectators haven't left the ground. The disappointment is so acute. Then I have to send a word I bleeding with this man at least tell let Imran Khan know that I'm reading his mind is gone is so disappointed dejected al-abadi Ramon sends word come in so I go in  And your you can hear a pin drop in that Pakistan dressing room. Nobody's talking to anybody. They all looking at their feet. All the players in one corner is Imran. And he said Sonny talks briefly to me and then he looks up and so this team from Pakistan was supposed to take the flight out that evening that night come to Bombay.
7:  Which descended on the Gaddafi that moment when the last you know, when the match was decided is something that takes me back and it was like Gloom had descended and I feared okay. I have no idea what might happen next. Yeah, people might you know, start a riot out of sheer disappointment within a few minutes wailing started people started crying specially the Jannah section where the women were sitting they couldn't believe it at all and I was in a very in a sense a privileged position.  In those days. I was ghosting a column for Imran Khan. Okay, so I had to meet him after the match.
8:  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India. So in that perspective Benny spell was a really important one to help India to get some psychological advantage of a Pakistan against a very  be strong batting lineup and also another interesting thing. I don't know if that played any part be a ten-year-old. I heard the word smog the first time in my life are Morgan the famous journalist who covered the game for the Hindu in the sport star, he wrote in that particular weekly saying the smoke cleared and the brief started coming from the hooghly and the calculations are filled up the stands with 70,000 people and the Metro was serving the city like London and Paris and Roger Binny put on a royal show here.
9:  Using bit of a natural element he was able to reduce Pakistan to very manageable first Innings total that helped India to set it up in terms of the game. Unfortunately, India couldn't finish the game off and Pakistan happened to save that game despite being getting another two wickets. So in that particular spell I'm talking about it took six 456 including four four nine four four nine against a very powerful batting lineup in Indian conditions has to be applauded because he wasn't  Or really quick poll. He didn't have the natural talent for a couple days and also another important thing whenever we talk about swing in the 1980s Indian cricket always thinks about Imran Khan and subtraction of us pakistanis of always beaten India in terms of trying to get the voltage swing whether it's conventional or reverse either in Pakistan or in India.

You know, I had it I had an addiction, you know alcohol drugs and those were kind of like in I was in and out of Institutions like the majority of my life. I thought I was a drug dealer, but I was really probably I could do I really need my heart wasn't really in selling drugs. You know I'm saying I just was because that's what was going on around that time and  That was an easy way to make money for me, but my heart was never any you know, so I think that kind of like one of the things that a lot of people didn't know I battled drug addiction for many years.

I feel like all the personal development workshops should be delivered by people in recovery. We should be giving them way more money to turn what's happening in the recovery Community into tools. We use at schools Etc not least because there has been so little money and so many extraordinary things.  Things are done and the creativity of the average key worker is yeah absolutely blows my mind even now if I go into a drug and alcohol service, it doesn't matter how many cool, you know cooler things.

Topic 14 near death experiences: I wonder if people have shared near-death experiences in podcast episodes.  I would like to find and listen to some stories.  I am not interested in the science of near-death experiences.
[1416, 577, 90, 3468, 2398, 52, 3467, 2462, 1415, 2823]
0:  To start the episode one. So I click on The Joe Rogan podcast. I find it go to episode one and like the fucking first 15 minutes of this thing. They're not even doing the podcast. They're like talking to each other about setting everything up on the computer and it's almost like they forgot that they hit record and this goes on for quite some time. And finally, it's almost like it's not like they realized that the mic was on.  They knew the mic was on but he just starts talking and he's so natural that even that very first episode where he really had no idea what he was doing.
1:  And sharing other stories will help Inspire motivate encourage and Empower everyone to follow their dreams and do all the things that they have dreamed of doing and so that's it for today. I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and continue to follow along and subscribe.  Have you been thinking about starting your own podcast when I first started thinking about starting mine? I had a lot of questions. What's the best platform to use? How do I even record an episode? How do I distribute my podcast on to all the apps people like to listen to can I make money from having a podcast?
2:  Subscribe to pasture Experience Podcast, wherever via whatever podcast app you are most comfortable with you can also find it on my website which is pasture experience.com. And you can also find out where the local and the weekend retreat. Those are as well in Tennessee. And then you can also go to my website at Becca poke.com again, I just if you resonate with any of these conversations or the topics that were talking about  I invite you to share it with people that you love and again, I know your time is so precious. And so really if you hear anything in this in this podcast experience, it's I just really want to invite you to listen to yourself because God's already speaking to you and it's probably in completely out of the box ways and there's nothing like this confidence that comes when we really tether ourselves and know him.
3:  Something a little different. I want to delve substantially deeper than I normally do and really get some, you know, get a bit of geek on and for those of you who are massively interested in the science. I know there is a huge amount of you. I'm going to delve really deep into the science physiology Anatomy biochemistry of specific mechanisms supplements molecules, or even human body. So that is going to be episode 101.  We get to a hundred and ten episode a hundred of course is going to be my favorite episode that I've recorded at any point in time. So we're almost there. You're almost there. This is a really cool episode. This episode was recorded actually a few months ago with end Lions now and Alliance is a client of the academy. He's been in our Academy where he's been within the spearmint Sunbrella for a long time and he has really over the last
4:  Thinking about so this is one of those episodes where I really feel this was one of those episodes that I like to consider a gut check episode for people because I don't feel and I'm not sure if you were to agree, but I think there needs to be a little bit more transparency and honesty not just a network marketing but an entrepreneurship people keeping it real like like how you and Julie do like things aren't sugar-coated, you know.  His life and I just appreciate just the rawness and the realness in the vulnerability that you've shared because sometimes you have to learn a hard lesson to create an easy path for yourself. And and I think this is one of those episodes. So I've two final things one final question, but more importantly can you leave the listeners with obviously where they can connect with you on social media website book podcast.
5: Singing experience where women gather for the purpose of deep connection and soul nourishment in my living room environment. And so my hope is that this pastor experience this podcast will offer you just that is your own experience to listen and be honest with yourself to come to know the trinity in a really intimate ways and join Soul nourishing conversations, wherever you are on your spiritual journey on your specific pasture and so here  We're going to bridge the beauty between play and contemplation and pasture Experience Podcast will be sort of like Soul Care met spiritual Direction met this deep Whimsy conversation all tethered and connected and rooted in Psalm 23. For those of you who are maybe new to the term Soul Care or spiritual Direction. I think the best way that I could describe this is spiritual direction. Is this Co companioning
6:  Did episode 101 102 103 104 all the way up until a hundred and ten are going to be extremely valuable highly dense scientific episodes. They're not going to be overly long, but they're going to be condensed it. They basically going to be a crash course on some really my new areas of the Fitness training space that I want to cover in exceptional detail I want to do  Something a little different. I want to delve substantially deeper than I normally do and really get some, you know, get a bit of geek on and for those of you who are massively interested in the science. I know there is a huge amount of you. I'm going to delve really deep into the science physiology Anatomy biochemistry of specific mechanisms supplements molecules, or even human body. So that is going to be episode 101.
7:  So I'm a deacon heart and so I don't see myself doing anything. Cuz what I meant to do, I think I'm life. He goes t on my past experiences in life. So next ten years ago. If you tell me what are you going to do? What do you want to do? I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be doing some salsa and data science, right? I saw as you know life is a straight line, but they tell you the straight line, but it's never really straight line. It wasn't for me for sure. Yeah. So what's going to be was like trial and error and try what works for you with this.  Work for me. I have a different personality than a typical engineer. The reason why I was playing moves from a political engineering physician. I felt like I needed to the social interaction. I needed that part of my job. So that's something that was I could have stood out from my peers. I kind of wanted to talk and I wanted to put them and that wasn't something that's a lot of people shared with me. And so I didn't know this was the case for me. So I think we're probably know we don't have a lot of role models in our field. We had a lot of black males.
8:  You're just kind of sitting here talking to your device and it is what it is. So a bunch of friends of mine told me to reference Joe Rogan. They were like you should check out The Joe Rogan podcast. It's one of the most popular podcast probably in the world. Right like this guy. He's got a gift and so I'm like, okay cool like okay cool. I'm going to check out Joe Rogan. So what better place  To start the episode one. So I click on The Joe Rogan podcast. I find it go to episode one and like the fucking first 15 minutes of this thing. They're not even doing the podcast. They're like talking to each other about setting everything up on the computer and it's almost like they forgot that they hit record and this goes on for quite some time. And finally, it's almost like it's not like they realized that the mic was on.
9:  rhythms their recommendations like they're not as how do I say this? It's not as good as like algorithmic spotify's algorithm for their music Discovery, right? I think podcast Discovery algorithms are people are working on it, but it isn't at like a level that you would see right now. I think one of the things that you were able to Now search for our specific episodes that you're going to be so in a podcast recommendation if you're listening to say a Made in India episode with  Like with Ida and integrate Apache Indian and then maybe he did an interview with someone else on some other podcast like maybe Bobby frictions podcast or something. And I think that if you see one episode like now instead of going to giving you show recommendations, they'll start giving you episodic recommendations, which I think is really cool. Yeah. So I think that technology that needs to get there the algorithms need to get there, but I agree with you. I think it's going to be really fast.
 
Topic 15 podcast about podcasts: I would like to start a podcast.  What equipment do I need?  What kind of microphone?  What sort of space should I use to record?  What software is most helpful?  What are some tips and tricks for using my voice well?  I’d like to hear general tips about recording and producing podcasts.
[245, 3940, 4472, 261, 442, 565, 1121, 1656, 1488, 3069]
0:  Into and inspirational end-of-the-year message. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, that was some drama yesterday. So we've been wanting to start a podcast for a while. Now. How long has it been in a while if I'm on top of mind and so I did my research to see? Okay. How do I even start what equipment do I need?  I need you know, how how do I do this? Because I had no clue. So what I got from my research was that we needed a good set of microphones. They told me that audio is important. They meaning Google and all the YouTube tutorials on podcasting what I got from it was that audio was important considering that a hundred percent of the time you're going to be listening to our voices. So if our voice is all you hear the night,
1: Welcome to the get to the point podcast. This is episode 1 and I'm your host Lesley Ann Quinlan. So why do we need another Fitness and Nutrition podcast? I mean there are thousands of podcast and there are thousands of podcasts that cover Fitness and Nutrition. So why do we need this one? Well in this really short episode, I'm just going to share with you three reasons why I wanted to start my own podcast. The first reason might be kind of surprising but I actually hate podcasts and that's why I wanted to start my own. Believe it or not the number of podcasts that I listened to on a regular basis. I can count that on one hand. I've tried for years to get into podcasts and I know a lot of friends love them know they'll recommend ones to me but in my experience so many podcasts are too long their rambling. They aren't focused. It doesn't even sound like the host plant with you're going to say before they hit the record button and I don't know about you, but I'm a busy girl.
2:  Yeah, first of all here, thanks very much for inviting me on your podcast. And you know, I don't do many podcasts or communities around like that. I don't do cuny's we had a find them kind of self-indulgent and to be born. I don't want to talk about myself for that long. So, you know, I just don't part of them and we're podcast they only did another one and it was with another artist and it was it was Robbie to say the least because their equipment is crap know their podcast was fun, but I had actually getting itself was like  It was it was a bad quality without was back then, you know, I was a few years back and it wasn't that long ago either mean the microphone equipment disaster. I proven something fierce in the last lick even treat for your so I'm
3:  Got it, and he just said go ahead just go ahead belong to but if you need anything else we taking everything back and I said, okay, I won't ask for anything else. So I go out and I buy another microphone and accessories and I came home and set it up and to Rican I got on Instagram live last night just to kind of test everything out. But for some reason you could only hear one microphone and so we're trying to figure out okay what's going on? And of course is my microphone.  And it's not like we set everything up correctly. It wasn't rocket science and our followers was like we can hear you but your husband seems far away. But when I did some more research, I found out that the Blue Yeti specifically does not recognize two of the same USB microphones and that the only way I would be able to use two microphones for a podcast would be to take back to USB mics which meant both of the blue yetis and by
4:  Have because some of my friends and family are still like yeah, we don't know what you did up there. Like what were you doing? And I have a lot of cool stories from from the island as well. So that's a little bit about me. Let me think what else I have three sisters two dogs back home, Mom and Dad. I'm 22 years old. So one of the reasons that I wanted to start this podcast is because I love being creative like I love having a creative outlet and I kind of always have I did blogging in the past fashion / lifestyle.  Blogging where I would like to share my outfits and talk about like college stuff organization tips, you know that whole sort of thing and I stopped that but I've like always just wanted to have something because I don't know. I just get too many ideas like stored up in my head. I need some kind of way to like let them all out. You know what I mean? And so the podcast kind of just made sense when I started it last year and like I said, I really missed it and I don't know I just have so many ideas and so many topics that
5:  I have done it but you know, you don't want to set yourself up and not like stick with something and then you have like this really expensive Mike or this make you don't really know how to use so I believe in starting like, you know where you can and then eventually over time getting better. I've had so many people who started listening to getting there. Like wow, your quality is improved. You sound so much more confident, you know, even though I have the same microphone that I have. Yeah, it's just like, you know, it's cool to see that progression and you don't need to be perfect from the beginning and that's  Something something that holds a lot of people back like I have a couple people that are friends or clients are like I've been wanting to start a podcast but XYZ excuse and I'm like, okay but like you can start and then you get better over time and then people are like wow, that's cool. I mean obviously you can't have like the crappy as audio quality because no one's going to listen. Yeah. No just start start where you can you don't need to splurge and buy the most expensive equipment from the get-go. If you don't if you can't afford it or don't want to afford it. Yeah, that makes sense.
6:  so I try to kind of put all my classroom management into like high gear and so I'll do almost like a little like holiday-themed thing where they can kind of spend their points on things. They can this podcast is brought to you by anger today. If you haven't heard about angry you guys it's probably one of the easiest ways to make a podcast. It's actually the website and app that I have my fifth graders used for their end of the year projects on writing opinion pieces and  Tell you the truth.

And another thing I want to mention is if you guys have any news articles or topics that get post unlike mainstream news sites that you want me to talk about and you think are just interesting that you think other people should know about let me know because I really want to start getting into like these news articles that people post about reselling or just Amazon eBay and  Earl are any sort of selling site in general just because I think it's interesting and I always liked staying informed on what people think about reselling the stigmas behind it and certain things that people think so this article is titled those Amazon returns. They're killing the environment. So this is just an interesting topic about how much stuff gets returned to Amazon and how much it's building up and stuff. I thought this was really interesting. There's a couple great facts on like how much returns are going to
6:  Thematically happening will happiness is not even happening as a wildfire. How do you control how people absorb the information from social media? You can't this is these are all incredible exactly microcosms of that that is probably the thing you can't control how people absorb stuff. So why not just put out your ideas and not care Mmm Yeah.
7:  And again, we can't hide from the negative but I think that because our society is more prone to negative. We tend to see it more. So we feel like there's more negative but there's a lot of good stuff out there and I want to talk about the good stuff today. So that's going to use it as like a positivity news report. So first off a couple years ago, I was at an event it was a Samsung event and there was this guy that I met Brandon and he started this thing called the good news paper and I thought it was genius and Brilliant thing and he's  Running out of Nashville, and he basically was saying just that like in those a lot of news that's negative and I wanted to start a newspaper. That's all about not just good news, but like how you can get involved. So sharing good news articles or positivity and things that are coming to the world but also like what can you do like if there's a charity how can you get involved or you know help support and I thought that was super cool and we kind of just stayed in touch for a bit over the years so you can totally go check out the good news paper if you would like, but I want to talk about a couple things that popped up for me recently.
8:  in that to Pivot the investigations, it's not like we're going to write that password in a report later on the report will only include certain findings stating. Hey, this person has this social media account and this other social media account and as long as it's not used in court and you don't have to reference every single thing you do. I think it's okay to Pivot based on that information again, it's a completely different story if this report that you produce will  Be used in court and you actually have to prove. Where did you get this then again? That's something where you might want to get the legal consultation. Okay. So before the other panelists chime in just real quick the chats going wild. Some people are saying talk to an established that long-term relationship with the trusted lawyer or legal counsel. So you can have that that that discussion with somebody that understands what you're doing what you're trying to do and can it can help you.
9:  Like they kind of pop up and there's sort of it's like the Daily Mail. That's what they're called and and different like news sources and it's just because I got a new computer and I don't really know how to turn them off and I will figure it out. I just haven't really spent the time sometimes like there's those things in life where like we know we could just sit down for 10 minutes and figure it out. But I'm just like a just erase cancel cancel and every once in a while they get me with something because they share a lot of these new things and I realized that people that you know, that that wake up every morning and read the news, you know, they're they're exposed to a lot of the negativity and  And again, we can't hide from the negative but I think that because our society is more prone to negative. We tend to see it more. So we feel like there's more negative but there's a lot of good stuff out there and I want to talk about the good stuff today. So that's going to use it as like a positivity news report. So first off a couple years ago, I was at an event it was a Samsung event and there was this guy that I met Brandon and he started this thing called the good news paper and I thought it was genius and Brilliant thing and he's
 
Topic 17 time between meetings: I am looking for some ideas for things to do during breaks between meetings.  I would like to take advantage of my short (half hour or less) gaps between meetings to refocus my mind or relax.
[1177, 2023, 223, 2374, 103, 1974, 1176, 842, 2895, 2375]
0:  Here and there but I was like I'll just take this with me. So like I fucking chugged like half of it and then I drink the rest like to get in a Harkins cup and just went to my meeting didn't think anything of it and I hadn't been to these kind of meetings in a while. Like my Wednesday nights are usually really busy with the kids. And so I go to the meeting I drink all my pineapple juice and in the morning, so Thursday morning I wake up and like I guess I lost some of my mucus plug so  Yeah, so I was like, okay, this is different. So I'm like Googling all these things. And of course, there are some things that are like, it could be hours. It could be days. It could be weeks that until you go into labor because the mucus plug is basically like this plug between like you and the baby and it's been keeping her safe up inside me from anything that can get up inside me and then
1:  what I feel like after this meeting, is that like  I think the chances of that happening are less than I might have been I might have thought before this meeting. Like I think the chances that it could actually be this bizarre situation where
2:  All right, perfect. Well, let's move on one other thing that and this one may not even be the best example, but one thing we talked about Fink like the test maker and you know, how do they make things difficult? A lot of times they bore people with the first handful of words when you get to the verbal section, I guess we haven't talked about the structure of a test all that much you're going to do an essay first. Then you're going to do what they call Integrated reasoning for half an hour. Then you're going to do the math section. Then you're going to do the verbal section to miss comes last.  Of benefit a center for at least two and a half hours before you even start to see questions like this. One of the things they like to do you're looking for I want to match up Ireland with this country. And so they made bore you a little bit or Take 5 or 6 words eight or nine words to even get to where you see what you want. So be forewarned here. You may even be thinking Hani the ecology be the same since might not thrown a ton of people off, but they love what we call the curve ball where if you know what you're looking
3:  the rules authorized us to be here today to I read the road yesterday authorized this I read well and I've been trying to answer your question rules authorized what we're doing here today. So everything that we've done here is valid and I guess Chris and of a consummate politician is dodging the heart of Demetrius question here and it's a question that pretty much everyone in the room has one week from now Nancy and Joe are going to have their own meeting on by just going to undo all of  It's a tough question and a few minutes later. Chris ends the meaning without really having answered it. Did you know Alabama technically has two separate time zones. I actually found this out when I showed up half an hour late when I fall I was half an hour early. It's like a really important interview of Randy Kelly Stone share read man. Also the vice chair and I'm seaworthy
4:  In my head, I could build up the pictures of kind of what it did and I had all these pictures in the back of my brain from how I'd experienced similar software systems. And so I did a two hour training with a one-on-one training with a customer and I'd never used the software before but by the end of it she goes. Oh, you're so good at this and I was like, yeah. Yeah, I am because I could just get through it like that. That's that's the power of our minds and they're so so powerful and in that meeting I really  seeded and I think one of the challenges we all have is in those meetings our brains rush off we go in different directions. It can be very hard to stay at least be able to stay present. So it's really important, you know, in some meetings like that. It's quite important to look at different things. You can use I use an app called oughta o TT ER AI now if you have a look at that, you can download it. I think there's a free version and what it
5:  5:30 in the morning. I've been awake for half an hour.  I wake up at like I wake up at five.
6:  you know things happen. So now I'll tell you about my birth story. So last Wednesday after work, I had a leaders meeting for my Buddhist organization and it wasn't until a little bit later. So I got home from work. I was cleaning up and I just like made a little bit of food and I'm like, you know what? Let me just drink this like whole fucking can of pineapple juice right now like it was in the fridge and I was going to have it like  Here and there but I was like I'll just take this with me. So like I fucking chugged like half of it and then I drink the rest like to get in a Harkins cup and just went to my meeting didn't think anything of it and I hadn't been to these kind of meetings in a while. Like my Wednesday nights are usually really busy with the kids. And so I go to the meeting I drink all my pineapple juice and in the morning, so Thursday morning I wake up and like I guess I lost some of my mucus plug so
7:  And so what I mean, so what do I eat? So I usually have for my because I'm an 8-hour night only had two two braids. So have the first break about an hour and a half to two hours into the shift. I'll have some blueberries. I'll have another banana might have a little protein sort of snack bar and that's about it. And then in the morning support about an hour and a half before I finish I'll have some breakfast and I'll either have  So like homemade sort of cereal but I make full of full of nuts and stuff like that as well as maybe your yogurt again. Nothing to too big. So then I end up getting home after after night shift just find out on that date our night shift that goes pretty quick after having two 12-hour shifts and then he hit an eight. It feels it would just sort of races by
8:  But looking ahead to the 2020 season this the curtain raiser for the season is always the been front of course, it was announced that it would take place on March the 14th floor to p.m. Start Saturday afternoon Gilliam scunthorpe the countdowns on countdowns on and did what would that be six weeks six and a half weeks time and I'm looking forward to that. I hope I should be able to make it down there. It's going for as a HIV.  imagine a game and we spoke to Danny one of my favorite tracks in the country always good to get some acts and Airy and for a good cause what more could you ask for exactly and you mentioned Daddy and I'm hoping he's going to be involved in that as you see we're hoping to get down get AB in Funda meeting always like to support us build regardless to it as if possible always make the effort to kind of go along but as I see a hopefully Danny as involved in that meeting, but he did it 2020 season of course with apps which in the Premiership and
9:  It's a tough question and a few minutes later. Chris ends the meaning without really having answered it. Did you know Alabama technically has two separate time zones. I actually found this out when I showed up half an hour late when I fall I was half an hour early. It's like a really important interview of Randy Kelly Stone share read man. Also the vice chair and I'm seaworthy  I wanted to know about Randy's anxieties going into this battle, like what it was just troops were thinking about it.
 
Topic 18 women in stem: I’d like to hear personal stories from women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  I am not interested in initiatives to increase women in STEM, or movements surrounding women in STEM, or news reports about the prevalence of women in STEM.
[2260, 2265, 2247, 147, 2246, 1414, 3118, 192, 2261, 3117]
0:  Earlier this year. I realized that the amount of women that were actually interested in sharing their stories would far outweigh the amount of events that I would have in the space that I had available and not only that I didn't think it was fair that these stories were only being shared to 20 or 30 women that were coming along to these events. So that's kind of put me in a position where I'm a determined as hell to grow the events, but also be wanted to create another platform where I could share this story.  It's not just the women that were coming along to the events. But to anyone in the whole wide world who was interested in hearing the stories of entrepreneurial women who are based in New Zealand, and eventually it'll be further afield but for now, I feel like there is hundreds of stories over here that I want to share. So I'm just going to start with them and then I'm just going to see how this kind of goes and grows and based on the feedback from you guys as the listeners. I will I guess pivot the direction of things as and when needed
1:  Because you have got it within you to be able to do whatever it is that you want to do with your life and these women and these stories that will be shared on this podcast. Will hopefully be relatable to you and you will see that these women are not so different from yourself and that if they can do it then you can too.  And I honestly have so much more that I want to share with you right now. But I also just really want to get stuck into these interviews and these chats with these amazing amazing woman and I would absolutely love to hear from you guys in terms of the types of things that you want to hear on the podcast and the people that you would like to hear interviewed. There is a place on the website. If you got a business build hers.com forward slash podcast, there is actually a link for you to nominate people. So if you know of somebody who's inspiring
2: I'm super passionate about the girlboss community and surrounding myself with like-minded women and I realized that there was an opportunity to create a platform to share stories of other women in business to inspire and to motivate and to help build a really supportive community of girl bosses in New Zealand. Hence the creation of this podcast. I really hope that you get as much value out of this as I have from creating it and I would absolutely  absolutely love any of your feedback with regards to the podcast. I want this to be a platform that you love listening to I want to be delivering interviews and content that you want to hear. So please definitely get in touch without further Ado. Let's jump in welcome to the girl boss chat series podcast, my name is Kylie Richardson, and I am the host of this podcast and the founder of the business Builders Community. I was initially not
3:  Again, more of his story coming out in other words. I'm not talking to any women. I'm not asking any women out because they're probably not going to like me anyway, so I'm not even open my mouth and even let a girl know I'm interested.  So instead you're acting like a woman and insecure shy woman.
4: You are listening to the go boss chat series podcast. I'm your host Kylie Richardson just to give you a little bit of a back story on who I am. I am a life coach for female entrepreneurs. And I also am the founder of the business Builders Community, which is based in New Zealand. Whilst I now call Christchurch New Zealand home. I am originally from Australia and made the move over the ditch about 12 years ago now, I'm super passionate about the girlboss community and surrounding myself with like-minded women and I realized that there was an opportunity to create a platform to share stories of other women in business to inspire and to motivate and to help build a really supportive community of girl bosses in New Zealand. Hence the creation of this podcast. I really hope that you get as much value out of this as I have from creating it and I would absolutely
5:  Women and you know who's going to want me when I go to try to get married or if I'm already married. How do I keep my husband where there's all those pretty women out there and I'm inside the house looking like this. I don't have that much money or whatever. It is in general. So we have these may be personal experiences. We have these social pressures and Trends and then we have our cultural things from our families. All these together can contribute easily to why we have body image issues. So it's not enough just to identify what the issue is guys. We have to actually do something about it or just  Going to get stuck in that rut. And in this case, it's actually extremely dangerous because as we look at it today, what we find is that you know, these things are women are actually taking their life over them. Women are getting clinically depressed. It's not something that's just like a light brush it off type of thing and I'm just going to give you my two cents. This is my personal. This is not from science or not from the Quran. It is based on the Quran obviously because I'm a Muslim and in terms of perspective, but it actually is very much based in the
6:  York we have one and almost no we have half a man does not have a Maddie's half-time in the London office. So yeah, I think there was a time when women's rights were a fight and women felt they had to it had to be just women only I think that we are in this country at least in the United States. I think we really now need to incorporate a lot more men. It's a struggle. I don't think men are that interested on sometimes now with the me to movement a lot?  Of men are scared. What is it like to actively have to recruit men into your organization?
7:  I was known as the began T's now she didn't revolt against the Romans presumably I like to feel into her as a woman presumably to keep our people safe. She decided to work with the Romans and become known as a client Queen. So this basically means that they that they had a partnership a relationship and  According to tacitus she actually divorced her first husband and took up with his arms Bearer and I love this story here. You have a woman 2000 years ago who was in a position of power who could literally do what she wanted follow her heart and she divorced her husband and she went with someone and married someone who she knew she deeply loved and these two women
8:  It's not just the women that were coming along to the events. But to anyone in the whole wide world who was interested in hearing the stories of entrepreneurial women who are based in New Zealand, and eventually it'll be further afield but for now, I feel like there is hundreds of stories over here that I want to share. So I'm just going to start with them and then I'm just going to see how this kind of goes and grows and based on the feedback from you guys as the listeners. I will I guess pivot the direction of things as and when needed  so the interviews or what I would like to refer to them as chats because I do not like the idea of me just sitting there and dictating the conversation. I feel like these women that are going to be on the podcast have got some awesome stories and the purpose of this podcast is for you to listen and connect with these women. It's so easy to get caught up in your own head about your own business and look onto these people through social media and through
9:  34 us diversity is getting more men also in the organization because I think from the hard to recruitment or Dance Project. It is hard to get men interested because again, if you're human rights organization, but focused on women, I think generally women are interested. So we we very much try to be very open to men and bring them in we have currently I think one we have two or three men in our Nairobi office who are great and in  York we have one and almost no we have half a man does not have a Maddie's half-time in the London office. So yeah, I think there was a time when women's rights were a fight and women felt they had to it had to be just women only I think that we are in this country at least in the United States. I think we really now need to incorporate a lot more men. It's a struggle. I don't think men are that interested on sometimes now with the me to movement a lot?

The AI industry cannot stiff-armed Healthcare and Healthcare cannot just rejected because at the stage where it is now, so we think this is very important and ideas also come from I mean 20 years in the industry knowing how and knowing how hard it is.  To drive confidence and Adoption of new technology and AI is it's a hugely and it goes straight into the core of what Radiology does and I mean I saw no, I never saw a technology that just went straight into to production of of of anything in healthcare. So we want to help both sides in creating this
2:  Color and in our communities caring for us those Health outcomes improve significantly. And so of course, there are other reasons for these poor health outcomes, but one of the solutions is diversifying the healthcare Workforce. And so that is one reason why I'm so passionate about this particular issue and why I wanted to start my company advancing Health Equity and so in my company I do  I give talks and trainings to healthcare institutions and Healthcare organizations. For example today. I'm actually flying to Buffalo to do a training for New York state with their family planning providers around unconscious bias and how it can influence how they communicate and make decisions about their patients. And so this is one of the reasons why I wanted to start my own my own company was that I can actually feel empowered to be addressing the

6:  Talk about it a lot of bias to it. So, you know, I'm gonna allow you to find your ways to engage your critical thinking practices on to this topic. Okay, so it's about AI more specifically super intelligent AI right. So artificial intelligence has made an immediate and Powerful entrance into our technological advancement. It's in our phones and our homes and our cars it has access to very important information AI is defeating world champions a very complicated games like go and chest right? The intensity has gone to  Point where a robotic AI has citizenship in a Middle Eastern country Saudi Arabia. I believe we have been so infatuated to Ai and admiring it so much that we haven't truly stepped aside to address some questions and concerns could artificial intelligence beats all advanced to where it has a capability to dominate humans or could we design it to only obey our commands one thing which confirm is that technology will definitely continue to advance the progression of technology is inevitable in a thing many people don't understand. Is that the progression of Technology
7:  Pain, I think in the process and you know that were there to get the pain and then find out what happens in terms of the the tech and there's a lot of aii around. I don't know how well you diligence is being done not on many of them and how deep that AI is at the moment but AI takes that many years to become fruitful and you know really deep and most of it's not there yet, and it's  About having that patient Capital to see that come to life and for investors to do much better due diligence on what AI actually is in healthcare and which ones are worth backing but I think it's going to take a lot of time and we're not there yet, even though there's lots of money going in that direction. So yeah, it's a confusing it's filled with lots of opportunities. There's lots of things, you know, lots of companies around this just
8:  Hee hee, it's actually a Roundup of the RS and a and the artificial intelligence and he says well, you know in his opinion the future of artificial intelligence really lies in teleradiology. He says this is the most interesting part of radiology where AI will probably have most find most applications. What do you think about is?  I think I'm in tell her age old is also growing so so it's a it's a it's a market that the growth but also comes from being very traditional and then it kind of the same thing as as Hospital radiology. But you you fix capacity now, they start to start to develop their business ideas. So I think they're very they're very well suited to add.
9: What about paper change? Welcome to another episode of the hyper chat. I'm here with Nikita. We have a really special episode. Today. We're going to talk about Oscar health and Hyper change in the healthcare system and why aligning incentives could be make a huge difference for the healthcare industry which in the u.s. Is super bloated and you also have your work for Oscar and you also have a Blog called negotiating the terms about women in VC. So we're going to cover all this startups Tech Healthcare really excited to have you on thanks for coming of course any time.  So, yeah, so maybe we could start before jumping into everything like maybe just give us a little bit of your background and how you got to working at Oscar. Yeah, of course, I basically studied statistics in history. And I think those two combos kind of guided why I got interested in technology so history certainly repeats itself, but you're like, why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? And one of the Pinnacle foundations of how things change is certainly technology? So that's the the History part.
 
Topic 20 cost of childcare: I’m looking for personal stories from people that have had to deal with increasing childcare costs.  How did they manage?  What was the effect on their lives?  Reports about average increases in childcare costs are not relevant unless they include quotes from individuals about their experiences.
[5069, 158, 5068, 157, 1301, 1302, 2490, 4976, 2187, 4977]
0:  To share these stories, you know my own personal stories, but then other stories from people that I meet along the way whether it's through travels or people I meet at home and become friends with entrepreneurs just people going through different life experiences. Like I had with my hiking experience and Utah anything. I want to share their stories so that everybody else can  Your how getting out of your comfort zone can really and truly help you live life to the fullest life is way too short and we should all feel like we can follow our dreams when you're a little kid teachers are always asking you like what do you want to be when you grow up? What dreams do you have? I feel like
1:  It's just assume that you will get to the point. If you start practicing that you'll be golden. But once people start to practice this becomes less realistic because as time goes on the costs both direct and up and opportunity costs slowly start to increase.  Reality creeps upon them and the benefits started decrease.
2:  People I'll say hey, maybe you shouldn't go zip-lining in Ecuador because bad things can happen, but I wouldn't have known if I didn't do it. And now I'm going to share it with you. It doesn't necessarily need to be so complicated and I feel like everyone makes it a little complicated now. I am really excited because my goal with Kaitlyn Castle Creations is too.  To share these stories, you know my own personal stories, but then other stories from people that I meet along the way whether it's through travels or people I meet at home and become friends with entrepreneurs just people going through different life experiences. Like I had with my hiking experience and Utah anything. I want to share their stories so that everybody else can
3:  So your imagine benefits might not be as great as you thought and the idea of practice of becoming a Trader this first imagined.  It's just assume that you will get to the point. If you start practicing that you'll be golden. But once people start to practice this becomes less realistic because as time goes on the costs both direct and up and opportunity costs slowly start to increase.
4:  But I remember one of my mentors telling me hey Mike. Listen, if you're going to invest in real estate it cost the same amount of money to get somebody out and check out, you know, it cost the same amount of dollars per hour to get somebody to check out an AC unit at a million-dollar home as it is as a $75,000 duplex, right? It's the same cost per hour. So what I would say is, you know to be in front of somebody who wants to sell their home it cost you the same amount of money to be in front of somebody let's say with this.  The cost of a postage right? It's the same amount of money to get their attention with the postcard because you know, a postcard ten-million-dollar home costs the same as a postcard to 50,000 or home or a hundred thousand road. So for me if it were me I would actually start with the neighborhood in the reason why is because you get to control that that cost to acquire a customer or what that opportunity is meaning if I know that I'm going to spend money and I know the average transaction price and the average what I would be
5:  The cost of a postage right? It's the same amount of money to get their attention with the postcard because you know, a postcard ten-million-dollar home costs the same as a postcard to 50,000 or home or a hundred thousand road. So for me if it were me I would actually start with the neighborhood in the reason why is because you get to control that that cost to acquire a customer or what that opportunity is meaning if I know that I'm going to spend money and I know the average transaction price and the average what I would be  be translated in the commission, which I charge like that haircut. But anyway, I digress if I knew what that cost in that earning potential was I could build a formula or campaign to go after those people. So that's number work. Number two. I pick a neighborhood because one of the things that you're going to struggle with is you'll see these people out there with like these weird domains like search nor Texas homes today MLS.com, right? And these are like unbranded URLs and a lot of us.
6:  Purrs, where is a competition within our trainers is like the person who does the best well moment in a month and you submit your while moments and it's documented they go above and beyond I don't care if he takes on out for coffee. You send some ubereats at the hospital because they're sick. I really don't care how you create. Wow moments. Create a wow moment. Okay, and then submit it in them the person who creates the best well moment inside your gym. They get a voucher. So it's like he's a pair of shoes good pair of shoes away every single month to the coach that creates the best while moment might cost you.  Box fill the silence like five. Wow moments going left, right and Center your full coaches 20 while moments a month that's increasing your customer experience. Remember, does it cost five to seven times more to get a new customer? So by giving him 200 bucks a pair of shoes or $150 per hour by met cons or something like that like that's going to increase your customer experience because you coach is going above and beyond now, I think wow moments is something that we can all Implement and really doesn't cost much at all and you're keeping clients for longer. You don't need to get more clients and also if you're creating
7:  You don't want to think about that. Yeah, and that be and nappies but say there will be a window in a life cycle where you will purchase that product. So for example from the birth of her first child through to the age of the youngest child sort of graduating out of that could be a period of five to ten years that a family will be in the market for that. So at some point that market ages and you've got to replace that market, so I'm sure that there will be some  in Zed people that will have children for example, and that they will become a target market as their life cycle enters in that sort of age range of being appropriate for a certain category because in some categories you fully replace your customers. You don't have them for Life say like maybe a mortgage company or home insurance might have you for decades. Whereas something like baby products or childcare or things like that are very sort of short-term their 5.
8:  The corporate think of it as a VIP room of Ripoff Report. If you join Ed will send someone to check out your company and write a long spiel about how great it is a Spiel which will be placed. Well above any negative report about you and then if someone tries to file a new report about you Ed will put that person in touch with you right away. You work it out with them as long as the customer is satisfied the report never posts. So it's as if you've  Dated yourself against rip off. It'll cost though. Look the average is probably between fifty five hundred and fifteen to twenty Grand but there's a lot of work that's involved with people think it's just like nothing the people I talked to this is why they call Ed an extortionist. They see it as ad using Ripoff Report to shake them down. Some people I talked to said if they could just get their hands on Ed. They would kill him wring his neck. I'd get so many threatening calls that he has a favorite section on the ripoff.
9:  in Zed people that will have children for example, and that they will become a target market as their life cycle enters in that sort of age range of being appropriate for a certain category because in some categories you fully replace your customers. You don't have them for Life say like maybe a mortgage company or home insurance might have you for decades. Whereas something like baby products or childcare or things like that are very sort of short-term their 5.  Ten years, but is it is this something that is there any particular brand or markets on the top of your head that has kind of like a tiger Market from start of life to end of my conside banking? Yeah, because that's you know, people need finance and payment and you see the bank's now appealing. I don't know if you've seen the wearable, you know the pay we're so caps and little chips and Rings the Halo ring that you're like a paywave god.
 
Topic 21 juneteenth: What does Juneteenth mean to people in the US? How do individuals feel about it, celebrate it, experience it? What are their thoughts and feelings about Juneteenth? Factual explanations of what Juneteenth is are not relevant.

0:  Individuality of many people everybody reading it me the song of myself the song of everybody reading it but it's essentially what we kind of talked about and we know we're in relating this back to Henry David Thoreau talking about you know, how to be your individual and how I raised the question of you know, the individual versus Community. I think that question about the individual is kind of Aunt  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we
1:  You know about the individual versus Community is very much answered in Song of Myself by Walt Whitman would he says he know we can celebrate yourself, but we can celebrate yourself as a collective and we're looking at this as a collective. You know, what is America America is experience and the experience of you but the experience of all of you people here that is what is essential to America and if we  Use that to answer, you know, it would look at it. I mean you by being an individual you're also a member of the community by just being yourself because you have your own experience that you're bringing to America and then that's not quite clear what I'm trying to say. It's pretty much I think what American literature is
2:  Them anything. It's really important for you guys to understand as well. And for everyone to understand is that no one can ever make you feel anything without your permission, but you also can't make anyone else feel a certain way.  So you are a hundred and ten percent in control of your thoughts feelings and emotions and how you react to certain situations and so is the other person I think that is so important for people to understand is that you have the right to let someone control your emotions, you know, if I mean if you want to then you can I don't see why you like it, but you are a hundred and ten percent in control.
3:  Like a party girl like she is like a wild child watching The Wild Child. She's what I wish I could be but she is really cool because she's just so individual and so herself and I feel like this goes back to our care said he had like last night be bold and I love that. She's so cold and I feel like that she's just so crazy and so cool with her outfits and it like really inspires me to be a bit more individual even though we do live in Ireland and people  like are judging our Georgie and don't get fashion that much like crazy fashion that I would love. I feel like there's so much potential in Ireland and Irish people to just because we're not that much of a close culture. We're not like we were one of the first to introduce gay marriage we example is there but I feel like people just are a bit judgmental. They're just meant but there are free to express their individuality because like I said,
4:  opinion it is and I love it. And I love how like she's a trans woman and she just rocked it Nikita Dragon. You should definitely follow her. If you're not already another one Jess Brennan table fast adjustment and I found just burning through X girls, which is it goes patreon podcast and they had to subscribe for it. But I absolutely love just Brennan. I've recently only got inter but  Like a party girl like she is like a wild child watching The Wild Child. She's what I wish I could be but she is really cool because she's just so individual and so herself and I feel like this goes back to our care said he had like last night be bold and I love that. She's so cold and I feel like that she's just so crazy and so cool with her outfits and it like really inspires me to be a bit more individual even though we do live in Ireland and people
5:  I don't think it's our default for most people, you know, but that doesn't mean there's not value in it just because we as a society have devalued something does not mean that it holds no value. I agree well, and then there's that whole thing of like our current structure is garbage and I can go on so many pots and feeling and so on my guess is why I think we haven't done the which podcast yet because I think it's going to be very biased opinions.  I have so many fucking thoughts and feelings about the structures in place, but it never hit that we're here for today. Right? This is not the content you signed up for. Okay. So, um, I know something we really wanted to bring to the attention before we get into any type of homework is as you're as you're feeling into things if this is like where you want to head
6:  Be without that peer support. I just don't see as much of a push in terms of black really making sure that our thoughts and our learning is like a radical around these topics. It's not radical enough to just see your professional and work on your individual stuff. It's kind of what I was saying before about that learning experiences from other people and it just that connection that you receive with other people whether it be online or real life or hopefully both just make you feel validated as a  Fussing and validation and being seen and being heard and being understood is so powerful as a human that connection that we get from that is like so powerful and healing and if we don't have that I feel like peeling process can take longer and also it just takes a different feeling because being isolated in your pain is not healthy for anybody and even though there's never going to be one person. I see exact same experiences you there will be people
7:  So you are a hundred and ten percent in control of your thoughts feelings and emotions and how you react to certain situations and so is the other person I think that is so important for people to understand is that you have the right to let someone control your emotions, you know, if I mean if you want to then you can I don't see why you like it, but you are a hundred and ten percent in control.  Of how someone makes you feel and if someone says, oh my gosh, you make me so angry but my awesome. What else can I make you do? Can I make you dance like a monkey like it's impossible for you to have that impact on someone else. It's impossible. Yes, you may do so like that makes them feel that way. But that's them. That's how they choose to feel. That's how they choose to react. They can, you know, understand that feeling and
8:  It should be if I break that for whatever whatever we do outside of the agreement or the mission at hand or the goal. You know, I mean people make it so loyalty is concrete solid in wrapped and sealed. No, it isn't she can change, you know, I mean and and and I think we'd be better off if we understood that, you know, you know a good man people make  Jokes, the money all the time like, you know, I turned 40 last month, right and people say, you know, everything is about all you for you now, everything is that but yeah it is I take pride in my age and median of me growing older daily and being able to spend another day on Earth with my friends and family and experiences, right? But the older I get the wiser. I do get in a better eye the chopper. I am with thought, you know, I mean and and I pride myself in all these these views of principles and things that I
9:  Close to the publishing date as possible. Just so that it's more relevant because even though this interview was done a few weeks ago. I like having the intro be done as close to when it goes up. Just so it's more relevant to my life. Like I want to tell you guys then my I'm in Miami and you guys are like, oh, yeah. I know that because I follow you on Instagram, you know. Anyways, I also wanted to thank you guys for the reviews that you guys have been giving this podcast, and if you guys have not yet given this a review, please please please do that and if you guys do  That DM it to me just so I can personally thank you because I think that just means so much to me and it's a really great way of kind of showing how you guys are feeling about the podcast because unlike YouTube. You can't comment on individual episodes, you know, so giving it a review is just really really helpful and that would just mean so much to me and in order to say my thanks. I wanted to shout out a reviewer of the week. So this reviewer of the week is Sophie and she said I just started listening to this podcast and it's hands down my favorite at the moment. I love the
 
Topic 22 chernobyl hbo: The series Chernobyl aired on HBO in 2019.  What were people saying about it in podcasts?  I am especially interested in discussions about how events depicted in the show differed from reality.
[1078, 1079, 3891, 1484, 1485, 1475, 1483, 3864, 3906, 1090]
0:  Since it came out it was a best-selling Series. So there was a lot of people who are optioning it for movies TV shows. I think there's a lot of stuff that's been in the works. I think but famously in the last 10 years in 2009 director stack Snyder of the 300 Fame developed that that the Watchman into a movie and this was kind of a lukewarm movie didn't do great at the bottom box office did okay, but it was also very polarizing reaction from the  fans of the series and it's also spawned I think the movie spawned video games and there's also a motion series that was part of it but diving into the TV to adaptation from HBO. So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the
1:  fans of the series and it's also spawned I think the movie spawned video games and there's also a motion series that was part of it but diving into the TV to adaptation from HBO. So the HBO series officially launched in October 2019 with the first season consisting of Nine episodes and is created by Damon Lindelof who is for the fan boys out there fangirls or fan people or however you want to say that he comes from the was the  Creator and showrunner for lost which was one of my favorite shows. I remember racing home when I was in high school to go and see like what happened. I'm lost except to like the later Seasons when it kind of died off and he's been a showrunner and kind of a person in in the industry for a while and the series being developed by him. It's been likened to like a reboot of the series but not really it's like also like a 34 years in the future, so it's not dealing
2:  Inside dealings of Game of Thrones and HBO at all. I have seen something going around online. Do I believe it? Not necessarily but that the pilot and the story that was being set set out to be told might have been somewhat problematic again. The I don't want this to turn any near close to fact. This is just a summer. I saw a thread of someone it's on  And the way the children of the forest were mostly, you know depicted as the the people of color performers and actors and then it was became this weird. They were maybe trying to tell a story which is maybe a valuable story to tell of of the the Andals and the conquerors and the old the old gods and the new coming on over and maybe taking over this land from the people that were already here. Again, that's not that that's a story that has some value.
3:  I like that. I think the one thing we just got human mind is this is in May so we have a lot of money right for DC Universe to make some announcements about how hey maybe we're merging or we're going to give you a credit like you're going to have HBO Max for this much time. So I it is really confusing right now, but we are a few months out. I keep thinking that this is coming out the same time as Disney plus Apple, it's all that but it's really it's in May right? I think that was a smart move on their part to push it. It is smart, especially because this next piece of news is that  that HBO Max is expected to produce major DCU films. So we're talking huge films here Mike as our Green Lantern in his room. I'm curious. Do you feel like what this is talking about with major films that we are going to launch characters in the DC Universe app or HBO Max app like Green Lantern and then have films also on the HBO Max or do you think that we're talking about characters that have nothing to do with HBO Max and just developing.
4:  that HBO Max is expected to produce major DCU films. So we're talking huge films here Mike as our Green Lantern in his room. I'm curious. Do you feel like what this is talking about with major films that we are going to launch characters in the DC Universe app or HBO Max app like Green Lantern and then have films also on the HBO Max or do you think that we're talking about characters that have nothing to do with HBO Max and just developing.  Dcts movies for HBO Mac. I don't know I think.
5:  I'll take me 20. So this is the selling point for you. Are you are already sold. Let's be honest. No, I'm curious because DC Universe has a lot of has all the Superman and Batman film. This is my question to the people. Yeah, and you guys are the people might do the people Ryan. You're the People by the people for the people. What's happening with DC Universe? I well let me finish the question pull up stair. Here we go. Yes friends still confuse. They keep making announcements about it, but none of it is making it Crystal.  Clear to me. So Green Lantern is and again, we'll talk about this in TV time. But it's going on HBO Max Doom Patrol will be airing on HBO Max, but then also seems to be right but then also it's going to be able to be streamed on DC Universe the Harley Quinn animated show still DC Universe Stargirl and we heard anything about that in a long time. Yeah on DC Universe so are people going to pay $15 for HBO Max and then also pay for DC Universe.
6:  is insane what they have and I don't like digital Comics but I love that pop pants are God says Hey need to merge DC Universe movies app into HBO Max shouldn't have to pay twice and and they haven't said that's not going to happen. We don't know. I don't think simply I see no, I see it was what $14.99 or something. It's the same as HBO Max and HBO or the same price and I see hey you can add DC Universe for $2. That's why he's going to happen. I think he sees place is going to go down what you  I like that. I think the one thing we just got human mind is this is in May so we have a lot of money right for DC Universe to make some announcements about how hey maybe we're merging or we're going to give you a credit like you're going to have HBO Max for this much time. So I it is really confusing right now, but we are a few months out. I keep thinking that this is coming out the same time as Disney plus Apple, it's all that but it's really it's in May right? I think that was a smart move on their part to push it. It is smart, especially because this next piece of news is that
7:  No one in HBO called them up and said anything about this. All right, there was he working with Netflix and they're busy not working with lucasfilm anymore.  But when the next day the again, we'll call it the blood moon pilot led by Naomi Watts led by Jane Goldman and predominantly I will say female lead a lot of the characters behind the scenes people are living and I don't think it was exclusively that and wasn't me build by that by HBO, but it was that to a lot of people again, you have to be understanding if that that gets cut the next day because of a bad pilot.
8:  They've got to go. They've got to move HBO Max is now in a war Disney plus Amazon Prime Netflix. We got Mandalorian Netflix's reputation pedigree of putting out good shows get Apple TV coming in with big for a Morning Show and see and all these shelves. We have got Amazon Prime working on Lord of the Rings got Wheel of Time floating out there. We got big things.  How do we get people to tune in to be interested in HBO Max CBS all access it guide to Star Trek discovery. That may be held a little bit. Now. We got Picard we've got to do that too. We've Got Game of Thrones. Yeah. We do have Game of Thrones house that pilot going not great. Okay, should we rework it? We worked the last one almost 10 years ago.
9:  3 so I highly recommend checking out the series and giving the HBO Watchman at a chance. I have never read the comics before and this was kind of my first foray into it. I really didn't like the 28 2009 Zack Snyder filmed mostly because I don't like Zack Snyder. I think his like 300 kind of garbage visuals but like no kind of character and I think that that was one of the critiques about the the movie but  overall definitely go check it out. If you're interested in kind of the Dark Realm and the weird is kind of intriguing to you. I definitely would recommend going out and also will share in the show notes some links to some stuff. There's some great videos from like alt shift X where he gives like an amazing background on the comic book series, which was helpful in pulling all this all this together. Well, that's it for for my notes on Space Camp. Thanks all for listening. Again. This is suren.
 
Topic 23 notre dame fire: The 2019 fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris personally affected many people around the world.  I’m looking for episodes of podcasts with people talking about how it affected them, how they felt about it, their personal recollections of visiting Notre Dame or otherwise experiencing Notre Dame in some way.  Factual information about the fire or about the cleaning and reconstruction effort are not relevant.

0:  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.  It was the most magical music and the people who would walk by in the morning would often stop for a moment or two to listen to The Sounds rising out of the Old Stone building not many people noticed. But if you listen closely, you would actually hear more than just the choir singing inside. There is also another noise that rose out of Notre Dame. It was a beautiful sound as well full of humming.
1:  It was a crisp cool morning in the beautiful city of Paris people sip their hot coffees and nibbled on their freshly baked baguettes in the cafes. They walked along narrow roads and over beautiful stone Bridges going to work or simply enjoying the city.  In the middle of Paris stands a large Old Stone building the famous Notre Dame Cathedral Notre Dame looks like a large castle out of a fairy tale with its huge sweeping towers and wonderfully carved images on the stone walls and even more magical almost every day. This Cathedral would fill up with the beautiful songs of the choir who came to sing at Notre Dame.
2:  Some other tragic news over the weekend related to Notre Dame is the arrest of land and bartilson the defensive back from Kentucky. That would have been coming in in June. He is not going to be coming to Notre Dame arrested with a couple others.  Stolen vehicle stolen Firearms. I'm not sure what all else is involved, but he will not be playing football for Notre Dame. Yeah, I mean, so it was less than 20 less than 24 hours before Notre Dame was basically cut ties with bartilson. I'm he's the only decision to make and they made it quickly. I guess I'm shocked in some ways that this happened and this singular instance, but also in some way surprised that Notre Dame has not
3:  C glow about them. Yeah, it's just a bad football team the whole I guess I can't stress enough the people that the bottom half the SEC sucks. And if that's all tournament, it's the bottom half of the other P5 conferences. They'd get skunked. Yeah. Well, I mean the whole SEC narrative is ridiculous. I saw SportsCenter guy after Notre Dame was just blown out by Georgia man. That was such an ass kicking. Oh what a minute Notre Dame was driving to win that thing in lost by 6 that if you didn't take Notre Dame in the points on that, you know,  Just keep on going with your narrative. The reality is Notre Dame it beat the last three SEC teams. They played in the last time they played Georgia a couple of years ago. That was a 20-19 stalemate that both defense has dominated again. No doubt Notre Dame is not at the top three top four top five Elite, but if George is in that top five Elite, they can play with them and it just gets back to anyway. I saw a sport. I heard a sports center guy Sunday night saying talking about Todd Gurley and saying, oh he's and, you know already enjoying the
4: Live I know that there's not much chance of them getting the playoffs but I just did a thing this morning about this would be five years of the last six heading into know which Brian Kelly has remained as had one loss or less going into November. So there's some significance of that guys. What are your thoughts on the line moving the way did well we thought the four and a half was Askew one-and-a-half made sense. And I want one by Notre Dame would have made sense to I you know, this usually late money is dumb.  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.
5:  Stolen vehicle stolen Firearms. I'm not sure what all else is involved, but he will not be playing football for Notre Dame. Yeah, I mean, so it was less than 20 less than 24 hours before Notre Dame was basically cut ties with bartilson. I'm he's the only decision to make and they made it quickly. I guess I'm shocked in some ways that this happened and this singular instance, but also in some way surprised that Notre Dame has not  Because it's college football and you're dealing with 85 young people who make dumb decisions sometimes like it's been a while since Notre Dame is sort of had the 2016. Yeah, and that Alton five four years is an eternity. It is in college sports to have dumb stuff like this happen. I mean, it's athletic tragedy for bartilson because you're throwing away like basically a you're closing off a door where your life could have gone because you made some really stupid decisions. It was yeah that
6:  Line stood on the edge of her house and took a deep breath. She couldn't believe this was it. She was about to fly to the Notre Dame and try out for Lim yet judges. She puffed her feathers and jumped off spreading her wings and turning in the direction of the Notre Dame Madeline looked down at the winding streets of Paris as she flew and felt excited and nervous all at the same time. This was it this was the day she'd been waiting for for so long  She had spent so much time practicing so much time dreaming. What would it feel like to finally sing for the judges at Lem yet? Would she be good enough? Would they choose her? She had been practicing for so long finally as she was thinking of these things. She saw Notre Dame in the distant as she got closer. She saw that all the pigeons were entering inside the building through a little hole in the top of the
7:  Any but also the smart meters is early and that one on there too. So all the money is going another Dame at this point. Either way, you want to have the spread one one and a half. I think what it made sense coming out. I favored Notre Dame's. I don't think it's weird and Michigan's much better at home than they are on the road. So you could definitely see a slight Underdog. I never at what we've been talking about it at no point did I think they should be more than a field goal favorite over Notre Dame heading in and as it turns out and I think most people now agree with that whether we're right or not. I'm surprised. I thought that the line made more sense of like Notre Dame.  She can being favored by one and a half two and a half something like that like sort of less than a field goal or right? Right, but nobody make favors is surprised because I think the great Timber a former Clemson SSID Notre Dame graduate said tweeted out that the last eight night games in the series. The home team is eight. No, I mean that would sort of lead you to believe that Michigan should be sort of a slight favorite in this game, but I think the better I don't buy that again.
8:  Although I mean a lot of people a lot of big games are being played well before January 1st, let's the load centers a couple of years a couple years ago. Now that I know people that's not a major six New Year's with but that was a good one. That was a to Primetime programs in a historic ball in the only way this is prime time is if it's Texas. Yes, and it's not the feel not that they're the best opponent Norton could play no but among the four candidates, I guess it although maybe they are I don't know Oklahoma State I think is challenging.  Yeah, but I think Texas is The Only Name that makes people think hey, let's tune and ESPN leading into the playoffs the Texas Notre Dame would be pretty happy about it as well. That's true. But yeah that because the lack of recognition of bullet is going to be disappointment. I knew and I both said watching Stanford, this is a Citrus Bowl quality Team Notre Dame Notre Dame Notre Dame. They are at least that they're deserve better than the camping Bowl this one time Candy World Bowl, but they're not going to probably get it. I don't know. I think they would
9:  Not career snaps by the rim Defenders against Navy that are playing in this game. Oh 800 career snaps for Notre Dame's Defenders against this against Navy in this game. That doesn't even include Kyle Hamilton will do a good job. Well and second year the Clark Lee's coordinated against it third year that Clark Lee's been involved in coordinating third against Lee has been involved in coordinating against it for a year because they plan for more than a week. I if someone's going to beat Notre Dame this  I am now convinced it's Navy because it's just a good offense. It's a great offense and a game defense. I'm not going to be too much more than that because I don't play the level Notre Dame enough, but 800 snaps man. They Notre Dame with Clark Lee should be able to hold them to four touchdowns or less and I'm doing 3124 Notre Dame.

I'll go and buy yellow car because no one's got one and then I drive it off the forecourt and everyone's got a yellow car. Is that kind of thing, isn't it? Like as soon as it comes into your Consciousness? That's what you see. I like the weather for what you call it the weather at the end of the news.  Is never accurate No No, but someone is the most accurate part of news if there is any accurate for sports sports. Hopefully I just believe if we blame people for the bad stuff. We also have to blame them for the good stuff. Yeah, one thing that popped up to my mind was Placebo. Hmm. We talked about thoughts. Mmm.
1:  you like these people I any of us forget the whole color thing for a moment, right? I think we all with our friends. We have great loyalty to them and we want to support them in any way we can and so when these people are your friends and you work with them and you're hearing all these stories, maybe you have an opportunity like I did because of the platform you're given and  Maybe you come from a different Viewpoint. You can say things that they can't and you can support them and I think any of us would support the people that we like and care about if given the opportunity. Yeah, it is interesting that I look at the the NFL and it was you know, obviously that's where Colin Kaepernick started the his protest lot of players decided to protest in terms of bringing attention to social injustice and Criminal Justice Reform at various.
2:  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.  The other day they like load of young people like took it over. I'm like it gives me so much hope because he'd be talking to your parents or things like that and they just like well like, you know, we've done this like we've lived half way through our lives, you know, like but seeing those sort of people gives me so much hope so finally like what gives you hope to carry on and like what gives you the drive to keep going with your work? I think I'm gonna like battle a little today, but I think the younger Generations are way more intelligent and compassionate.
3:  To like be more conscious about the environment like where do you even begin like top three things to do definitely educate yourself? Yeah, because a big issue is like people don't know how to defend themselves. And I think that's how you like Lou you kind of lose run of yourself while you're doing it in the first place so educate yourself but not to the point but not to your breaking point where you're like, I can't decide the only thing I can think about and it's really causing you anxiety. Like I'm at my point now where I know all the information I'm not going to read anything in. Yeah, we're about it because I already know and then secondly is  Trying to change your individual Life Sale. Everyone knows that goddamn red meat but educate yourself on why to do it fast fashion obviously cut down on us put down your pasta consumption and maybe use public transport. If if you can I know if you're living in Dublin is way easier to then if you're living in the country and then the third thing is to go to protest and that's free. And I know if you're in school, there's good. There's a girl and are square. I put on my story before who protest on Saturday so it's honor. Oh, I'm sorry.
4:  That's a different level. So when we go towards our people and we speak into our people we have to be solution based and not just problem-based. We have to be enlightened and based on I just aware based right? We can't just go out there and protest what I was solution to follow up the protest with some action.  And we have to be inclusive with how we work together continuously consistently and intentionally. Somebody asked me today. I'm doing a consultation for young lady starting a business. You might be out here and she say what is the thing that working for you right now?
5:  More fumes into the air and actually anything they probably the type worse. Hmm and the amount of usage on people's phones over there and actually the school protest that's even worse because you're shocking people from learning, you know, you might get Old Timmy who bit slow in his math class and he can't do is bet you can't concentrate because of the environment the same people are stopping at work and he can't knees got to do it's just people's incompetence of negotiating and actually using the art of talking and communicating.  And resolving it with attention-seeking and doing other things and those are the people that started that protest would have When I'm Gone.
6:  It's something but it actually nothing, you know protest against it was saying it was just a novelty and I do genuinely think they did care about the environment and thought they cared about the our own but in real life no one else it came across from all perspectives as a joke. Well, I spoke to me weren't joking. No, they weren't joking about about the perspective of everyone else on based or as a joke and wasn't as a joke. Yeah. It was it literally was a joke. It was an excuse to Flap about for and you look at some of the ones up in London. Some people thought they were  do something good but some other links to London, how did I get to London? Some of them thought they were doing something good. Some of them are there for a laugh and some of them genuinely passionately cared someone at the majority of the Snapchat stories. I saw a guy at that London protest who climbs is quite funny actually climb the Victoria Monument outside Buckingham Palace and started waving the Soviet flag. They climbed up to the golden bit and started flying the flag thing is how else how do they get? How do those people get there? Yeah. I think a lot of people do it to say that they've been they would have they would have caused loads of traffic which is

8:  Is as a white man is generally because they've had a mint is normally a mental patient or they've got mental issues or psychosis or schizophrenia or whatever if it's somebody of Asian descent than the generally terrorists and if it's black then it's gang crime like the way that people just get put in these boxes is ridiculous and I like the new things got broken men like you say it all it does is install fear into people who then put on whatever they've been programmed.  Rammed with this news out to everybody else. And then they almost it's almost like gets to a point where I think people are you say create that your I mean like it's like that whole thing. I'll go and buy yellow car because no one's got one and then I drive it off the forecourt and everyone's got a yellow car. Is that kind of thing, isn't it? Like as soon as it comes into your Consciousness? That's what you see. I like the weather for what you call it the weather at the end of the news.
9:  In Yemen, that's the most it will do but a good news story does the same but the thing is as well. That's all it did really raised a bit of awareness and we're talking about work, but for me, I got so pissed off of it because you just see and I do regretfully going to say this you saw these white school girls going, huh? 7:10 your bed. Yeah. Look at me. I'm saved the world is that this goes to the Howard that started that that protesting all  Global warming protest Jesus. It was just unnecessary. What did it do? It was it did nothing. It means better while seeing it was just an excuse to have a little muscle program, which I'm all for but you don't need to do it in the name of environment during the name for fun. Yeah. Well, it was horrific. They didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I asked them. How did you at school today? Megan odds me mainly because really they came my car and I also said that thing you just got for a curry. Yeah, is that carbon neutral they said
 
Topic 25 black lives matter: What do people mean when they say “black lives matter”?  I am interested in personal reflections that give context to the phrase “black lives matter” and why it is important to individuals.  News stores about Black Lives Matter protests are relevant as well.
[1197, 1198, 4330, 429, 4329, 1189, 1155, 1703, 1704, 1524]
0:  You matter so much.  Your decisions your actions your life your thoughts or questions. You have things that don't make sense to you your life matters so much to the world and that's why it's so important for you to design your life in a way that you reach your fullest potential because the world needs you and because God created you for a reason and you're special and we need you to become the best.
1:  Your decisions your actions your life your thoughts or questions. You have things that don't make sense to you your life matters so much to the world and that's why it's so important for you to design your life in a way that you reach your fullest potential because the world needs you and because God created you for a reason and you're special and we need you to become the best.  version of yourself
2:  Although it is important for us as individuals seeking self-betterment to have motivating aspirations the majority of lessons. We can learn from Life are while we are standing still one such example is learning the ability to be patient patience is not in human nature. It is a learned behavior naturally humans are drawn to instant gratification. This can be seen in every aspect of Our Lives whether it be through technology personal relationships, or even our careers when one can truly learn patience when one can learn to  Truly content in their Solitude they begin to understand bit by bit what life is truly about now. It is important to note that there is a difference between being content and being complacent complacency is the adversary of the productive individual where contentment says I can find happiness in this state for now complacency says I can stay in this state forever. There's a fine line between that apathy and being fulfilled when content in individual will recognize the world around them as an endless space for
3:  I was like Wow re that was good and it's so true because even the most important people in your life don't see every part of your life. They don't know how much those things mean to you the important things. They're not there with you on the hard days the days when you want to do something but are just crippled by the fact that someone might make fun of you or someone might have something to say about what  You're doing if you let other people control your life, you're never going to live your life even partly to the fullest because you're so worried that someone else that means nothing to you might have something negative to say about it because the people that mean a lot to you in the people that care for you won't bring that negativity into your life. There's a difference between constructive.
4:  Sigmund entity at the core of life and in contrast the obstacles and trials it produces for his by these experiences, although undoubtedly some unpleasant that we as humans can better ourselves even without tribulations one can still learn a thing or two from the habitually boring state of life life does not always require a driving force unintentionally. We have grown accustomed to the belief that we can only learn from what life has to offer if it is in motion. I'm extremely guilty of this.  Although it is important for us as individuals seeking self-betterment to have motivating aspirations the majority of lessons. We can learn from Life are while we are standing still one such example is learning the ability to be patient patience is not in human nature. It is a learned behavior naturally humans are drawn to instant gratification.

5:  So you don't need to be selfless. You just need to be not too selfish and that's enough and that's enough and this is actually very important because helping a lot of people look at it as something they're doing for others. All right, but if you design your life in a way in which you're helping yourself your family and then you're helping others Community or the wild world.  Existentially deep within you you're going to be the most happy person in the world. Why because there are certain questions in the world, which do not have any mental answer like if you ask someone what is the meaning of life no matter what the answer will never convince you right the meaning of life. You can only feel it. You can only feel it inside. And when do you feel it when you are living in a
6:  You as an individual matter so much and you play such an important role in the world and everything else is secondary to this. Everything else religion says it's only talking to a person who takes themselves. So seriously who sees their role that they play in the world and then once you look at yourself that way then everything else makes sense and then  Explain that why do we add any point if you feel like I need to explain something more or yeah, so if you look at our life, there are certain people in our life right now, which were directly influencing and there are so many people in our lives like relatives or sometimes even people in their nuclear family people that need their help. I'm sure in our audience we have so many people whose parents are probably like going through some sort of illness that they need. They'll help.
7:  I think I'm fucking to we had the people don't like me you'd be like, but the reason I love you is because you're weird like you keep my life. So interesting. So we need to question these things really rigorously and like you said apply them to all areas of our life. Yeah. I I totally I mean I'm going to start employing that today. Yeah, thank you, of course, but one thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting and something that I went through is the all black thing. Hmm. I went through a depression and I lightly wearing  Black still that that's a choice for you. Now, whereas like before I feel like for me it was a trap. Like I realize I went through a period in my life where I was so disassociated with who I truly was in my gut and my soul and I stopped wearing color and this was like a little girl who I used to wear red leather pants to school in sixth grade and like cheetah print in boas. Like I was I mean weird, you know a bad bitch. I was I was a bad bitch. I really I look up to my 12 year old self a lot, but I
8:  Black still that that's a choice for you. Now, whereas like before I feel like for me it was a trap. Like I realize I went through a period in my life where I was so disassociated with who I truly was in my gut and my soul and I stopped wearing color and this was like a little girl who I used to wear red leather pants to school in sixth grade and like cheetah print in boas. Like I was I mean weird, you know a bad bitch. I was I was a bad bitch. I really I look up to my 12 year old self a lot, but I  Through a phase where I were nothing but black and I think it's really important to notice those things that might just seem like oh, it's just whatever. That's just what I'm wearing right now. Those are Clues to what's going on with you inside. So it's really important and just something as simple as bringing color back in helps you breathe the life back into yourself. It really does and like you said, you know asking yourself those questions like oh is this just what I like or it's like actually no, am I trying to hide am I trying to be small? Am I trying to look skinny? Am I this that the other thing?
9:  And when people hear that, it's the same thing like with school. You're in trouble your grades weren't good enough. Do you if you're an adult and you're listening to me, do you realize how worthless your fucking grades were now? I hope you understand that your GPA doesn't mean shit in the real world and in life. It matters 0% where you graduated whatever accolades you had valedictorian magna cum laude cum laude, whatever like it doesn't mean anything. I graduated college cum laude just for the record. It doesn't mean fucking shit to my life. I don't identify.  Bye with it. I don't care about it. Anybody who's hired me in the past 15 years has ever asked about it. It means nothing.

Topic 27 civil rights protest stories: I’d like to hear stories about protests and protestors in the Civil Rights movement in the US in the 1960s.  Stories about individual experiences with protests; individuals’ motivations for protesting; how protests like the March on Washington came to be; the roots and foundations of the movement; etc; are all relevant.
[199, 203, 202, 195, 200, 2044, 350, 334, 186, 2457]
0:  What are you trying to do? I don't understand what is wrong with this country right now firstly an illiterate leader is getting into the getting into the hostels in universities. I don't even know if he has ever seen those universities for his own benefit. This is something really stupid.  What now talking about these students protest a lot of morons would even say that wider students have to go and protest when they go to study in the universities. These students are not protesting for the purpose of violence. They are protesting for the purpose of spreading awareness.
1:  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi  I was ordered to Lottie what was ordered to encourage that he charged now a lot of you might also say that Delhi police did it it's nothing about our government our leader or our prime minister. Let me tell you how the leap on this works then leap police is not under anybody's control except the home minister of our country. Not even the state government.
2:  This is the time when students are coming out with junks people are raising their voices when we are saying that India is going to be super power 2020 that is average age of all. The people in the in India is going to be 29 years. That is the most amount of Youth in our country and still you think that we should be blindly sitting and supporting whatever the government is getting us.  We need to be well informed citizens. We need to be rational citizens. I am not saying that we have to support violent protests. All I'm saying is there are peaceful protests around the country. There are ways for peaceful protest and we need to understand that these students were not protesting violin T. These students were protesting peacefully marching towards the parliament where Delhi
3:  Those were not students and this has been confirmed by the police itself Delhi police arrested 10 students for violence and out of or tends to saying that those were 10 students, but when it was found out those were not the students but some locals who were judge who got involved in this protest and the middle for their benefit.  I'm not saying that protest might not go wrong. They might but it doesn't mean that we have to stop protesting.
4:  What now talking about these students protest a lot of morons would even say that wider students have to go and protest when they go to study in the universities. These students are not protesting for the purpose of violence. They are protesting for the purpose of spreading awareness.  If nobody is going to raise voice against what is happening in our country, the government will have the power to do whatever they want to which means we are ready to accept any Injustice coming our way. We accepted Kashmir. We accepted trance discrimination. We are now trying to accept citizenship Amendment bill.
5:  On November 10th, 1917 38 year old Lucy Burns and 32 year old Alice Paul cofounders of the national woman's party were arrested for protesting in front of the White House along with 31 of their fellows. This was only one of several demonstrations held to pressure President Woodrow Wilson into supporting a constitutional amendment granting female suffrage.  See and Alice organized the national woman's party with the express goal of granting women the right to vote in an unprecedented move Lucy and Alice organized the first protest ever held in front of the White House itself on January 10th, 1917 protests began in Earnest. The suffragists crowds were often small, but they were also persistent they arrived at regular
6:  is democratic so would most likely side with Hong Kong in this form of the protests which would yet again influence the imports and exports and ruin our training and also all the other benefits that we get with having an international relationship with China.  Thanks for that. Great Insight Harry right now. I'd like to introduce our final guest with a different take on the scenario Zach Jamison.
7:  inflation may enable China's have palette intimidate or silence dissidence. This would also be a massive issue for freedom of media and freedom of speech. The first big protest was on the 9th of June where an estimated 1 million people marched the government headquarters to show they were against the proposed bill. So kind of sounds as if the protest for the starting to be peaceful. So, how did I become so violent? Well while this is a peaceful protest three days later police were firing tear gas and rubber bullets on the 15th of June the Hong Kong leader care.  I made a dramatic reversal and promised to indefinitely delay. The extradition Bill protest was with throwing bricks and petrol bombs back at police. And this is causing a massive issue in the city the next day 2 million were on the streets calling for the complete removal of the bill and Caroline's resignation many Saw hers beijing's puppet slowly cutting Hong Kong's freedoms in passing power to mainland China. So I heard some rumors about the Chinese government instigating fights and what moat can you clear that up?
8:  Talking about universities talking about students what has happened in Jamia and aligarh Muslim University firstly.  This is something unbelievable unexpected unexpected it began with jnu where because of the price hikes and protest against it students were beaten up and now when students are coming out and peacefully proper piece fully I'm saying protesting against the government bill citizenship Amendment bill.
9:  We had two more years I graduated after out of his contract, but he opted out with it the intent that he was going to sign another deal. So alright. So Colin Kaepernick before we even go into the plot twist on it.  Ratings are down here. Right? So you want to go down so from to so cap starts his protest for social injustice specifically police brutality in 2016, and he's out 2017. So the ratings go down for two years in a row now last year the ratings did go up 5% for the NFL but a lot of that could be true contributed to the surprise of these like teams and great players like so example

Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?
5: Welcome to the breaking up with yo-yo dieting podcast. I'm your host Amber Mackenzie. I'm an author speaker and former yo-yo Dieter turn successful weight maintainer and I get to live in a body. I love each week. I'll share stories practical strategies and have inspiring conversations with guests to help you get and keep the body you dream of now, let's find out how to bring up with yo-yo dieting and fall in love.  With yourself. I was now nutrition and I wasn't eating that obviously led to me getting Cravings because when the body can sense that you are lacking in a main macronutrient or nutrients, it will send signals of hunger to tell you to keep eating until it's actually received but it's after this podcast is not meant to diagnose treat prevent or cure any medical or mental health condition. Please check with your Healthcare professional before making changes to your diet or exercise program. Hello everybody.
6:  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a  Start to you know to sad introduction to diet culture. But as you're telling me I'm thinking this is like so many people that I see this is an I felt so alone at this point. I remember sitting on the couch going what is wrong with me? Why is if no one's talking about it. I believed that it didn't exist that there was some fundamental floor. Everyone else have willpower. I didn't and I blamed myself for a long time by the time I'm 17. I'm deeply unhappy. I'm deeply disappointed.
7:  This is where am I eating? Disorder was kind of, you know going full strength and it's you know, I reach the goal. Even when I go to my goal weight though. It wasn't as though I ever felt good enough. I always look to myself. Oh, you know, I could still lose weight and everyone around me thought yeah, you know, you could still lose weight and yet I was in a really Slim body or still not good enough. As soon as I stopped seeing this dietitian. I fell into binge eating so, you know, I knew everything I needed to do yet my body took control.  And you know, I try and be good and then I'd end up on you know, eating in private in secret in the pantry hiding food hiding wrappers eating way more than I physically wouldn't had I never gone through this and all because of the shame the guilds and this vicious cycle of the the yo-yo dieting. So for me, I did experience all the extremes, but I also experienced just the yo-yo dieting. That's so many people go through. Yeah, that's story Lindy that you're just telling me it's a
8:  Sizes and not diet but lose some stubborn fat. She says a healthy lifestyle is what I want. Not the yo-yo dieting and that sort of speaks to I suppose what we were talking about before is that a lot of people kind of want to try to achieve The Best of Both Worlds. They don't want the yo-yo dieting but they do want to lose some fat. So what would you say to Liz and the million people out there like her?  Great question and I think you're right. This does talk to what we were saying before. Okay, so I'm just going to give you some more healthy habits to give you some ideas or some little ways to just improve your health and it may have been qu8 in losing weight. So we know we talked about not having alcohol during the week. So that is one option. Another option is to increase your steps for the day, you know, some people find that have been a step cut counter can be controlling other people don't so just find if you're one of those people that you
9:  Their first diet and to think of that number going lower is like heartbreaking to me because when we think about I've been on diets for the last 15 years and we think that that might increase we know the damage that's been done from the yo-yo diets to to your metabolism. We did an entire episode on that and how those crash diets are damaging your metabolism and always had before as podcast. We were exposed to that whenever we were in our 20s, right, you know did some damage so  ISM thankfully been able to recover and most people will be able to recover but what about if we start that yo-yo dieting at the age of 12 my God, I mean, what is that doing to a growing metabolism to a person that is constantly going through changes that are affecting their body and then we put a yo-yo diet right on top of it. It seems to me that is it's just it's unbelievable and it's I can't even believe we're having this conversation.
 
Topic 29 racism in canada: How does racism appear in Canada?  I’m looking for personal anecdotes about peoples’ experiences with racism in Canada.  Research such as sociological research is relevant if reported on.
[48, 49, 3748, 73, 295, 931, 1005, 451, 450, 72]
0:  Is the difference is he Embraces his conditioning and uses it for political purposes. So I call that a vowed racism and to the best of my ability. I am committed to challenging my racist conditioning and the reason why it's important for me to distinguish to make that difference clear is I don't think it's useful for me to position Trump as racist and me is not racing because that invokes what I think is probably the most  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and
1:  brilliant adaptation of the system of racism to the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement, which is we kind of made a racist a very simple formula. If you notice how white people respond when charged with racism it would appear that in the white mind racism must be conscious and must be intentional in order to count which beautifully basically protects the system of racism because it's often not conscious and  Early intentional or if it is intentional. We're not going to admit to that right? So this this adaptation to make a racist really bad and you know, everybody else is good has made it virtually impossible to talk to the average white person about their racist conditions, right? And I think it's the root of all white defensiveness and I think that's what's happening when barbecue Becky is being told what you're doing is racist nice people and I'm sure she sees herself as a nice person can't all
2:  Across the very very special special ones who actually really really are interested in the sociological questions and in the epistemological challenges, and we've just started working on an ESL C funded project, which is trying to look we're not trying to it will look at how semantic web Technologies can be used for sociological research. So we're actually going to test drive some of the semantic web Technologies to look at in particular the relationship between social class aging and health over the life course, and so we've chosen deliberately really difficult social Concepts.  Is that sociologists themselves can't agree about the try and see what happens then if you try and describe those in semantic web terms, what are the challenges? What are the difficulties where do the differences between sociological thinking and computational thinking appear? What are the controversies? What are difficulties how do we transform them? So some of that's about the sensibilities and beliefs of the people and some of it is about how those are embedded in the artifact or the tools of the
3:  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.  So another another piece of evidence that white people often give is our minority status in another axis of social life. Right? And so the question that I would offer a white person who experiences oppression is somewhere else is what does racism look like in your community what a in particular anti-blackness look like in your community. What does anti-blackness look like?
4:  Think Hmm and even just like one city over like Montreal gets worst Winters than we do. They get awful snow and cold Calgary to cover its really bad Winters and then obviously we have like all the way up North to the like Arctic. Yep, totally different the territories. Yeah, Canada is vast but mean we don't have any like deserts. That's true. Yeah the Prairies I guess we were actually talking about this. I mean, I'm sure there's lots of countries where this is true I mean, Mexico  Anywhere else, but somewhere like u.s. You know, if we want to move somewhere warm that's still in our country. Like we can't do that. But if you are from like the northern Us New York or something, you can move to Texas, Florida California or even just a different part of California and have different weather, but we appear in Canada. We all got the seasons. Okay, live t coming in hot with the questions. I don't know the exact answer.
5:  Offended when I discussion about racism occurs, so we look forward to doing what I believe is the Creator's will and that is for us to live this truth. Yes. I recognize that that is necessary in order to end racism. Could you begin by stating?  What your perspective is about the existence of racism? Oh talk about what what it is. Oh, I agree with the with the principal.
6:  She said don't get she said Miss move it all that. Oh, my best friend is black. So she's saying that she don't want to hear that. Wow shots fired shots fired stated that you're interested in solving this problem and ending racism in your view if the system of racism white supremacy is ended what benefits  people experience
7:  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.  Important to say actually let's go granular and let's say I'm going to break down what anti-blackness is and in our I want everyone to sign up to that review of even within the black community because a lot of black people are anti-black also, they believe many of the messages that have been, you know communicating to them. They don't trust other black business owners. They think they're every black man is a threat and it will cross the road when they see a black person in a
8:  basically saying you don't see that we are different in any way shape or form and if you may not be racist potentially your parents or your parents parents definitely held some extreme views because the times at that Arrow was more allowance or allow a allowing of that and so it just is we understand that it's a funnel. It was a very big funnel and now it's getting narrower and narrower and a group of people that believe that and but we still have it. So yeah that that that's what was really kind of sort of living on my mind and really  Clear about what racism is and actually moving away as a black community from racism into this idea of dashes anti-black and actually self identifying the experiences that we have received that are considered anti-black and I think moving away from this collector term of racism which is nuanced and confusing and has nothing underneath it. There are no examples of racism underneath that definition. You just got to use those words to Cobble it together and I think it's super important.
9:  I am not racist, right and I want to challenge that and offer that niceness is not anti racism because niceness is not courageous. There's absolutely nothing Courageous about niceness anti-racism takes courage like incredible courage and risk and you are not actually always seeing as particularly nice when you  Push to get racism on the table. So white progressives often just see that again if if I'm you know, relaxed and friendly across race. I am free of racism. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not too many ways committing microaggressions, but that is not going to interrupt the system of racism, right? It's not going to change our policies. It's not going to challenge barbecue Becky is in terms of challenging systemic racism is kind of meaningless, totally.
 
Topic 30 motherhood: I want to hear podcast episodes with new mothers relating and discussing their expectations and experiences for motherhood.  Stories, conversations, panel discussions are all relevant.  I’m not very interested in hearing from experienced mothers.
[6, 109, 1070, 108, 804, 327, 646, 5, 1850, 331]
0:  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage. Now everyone who has experienced toxicity with their mothers has a different story. Sometimes the damage that is done is mild. Sometimes the damage is moderate and sometimes the damage is on a yalla yalla fix my life.  Life pstd level. So toxic motherhood in a nutshell is a mother a step mother a grandmother in Auntie or a primary caregiver who essentially does a very poor job at parenting some toxic mothers are controlling some toxics mothers can be the rating and hypocritical some text toxic mothers can be envious and jealous some toxic mother's compete with their daughters some toxic mother's work overtime.
1:  this experience of motherhood has has been really fulfilling so far.  Motherhood sessions is a production of gimlet media. It's produced by Peter. Bresnan. Our editors are Devon Taylor and nausea and rafsanjani music and mixing by Emma. Monger will have a brand new episode next week. I'm 42. I'm a single mom. I intentionally, you know had a child on my own and so because of that there's just feel like like an other
2:  Thought I'd mention that right off the bat. Hopefully I'll do a podcast on long-distance relationships and just relationships in general in college. So stay tuned for that. But I don't want to make this podcast too long since it is just an introduction. I really hope you all will stick around though and give me a chance because I will have new episodes out every Wednesday morning. So yeah, if you guys have anything that you would particularly want to hear, please  Let me know because I'm open to doing anything. I tend to be able to talk a lot just because I love talking so much. So, please let me know if there's anything you want to hear. One thing I want to do at the end of every single episode is do kind of like a quote. So I guess every episode just have a new quote. So today is quote is the key to success is to start before you are ready. And that was by Marie. Forleo.
3:  Powerful way my no. I'm not lie. I'm leaning and like I'm leaning towards thinking not thinking that that that  this experience of motherhood has has been really fulfilling so far.
4:  first episode chosen aspiring podcasters will get a chance to record their pilot episode in our world Glass Studio here in digitrax. We will host and promote your first podcast episode and if people love it and want to hear more from you will develop it into a full series. We've got bread podcast Network.

5:  It's not just the women that were coming along to the events. But to anyone in the whole wide world who was interested in hearing the stories of entrepreneurial women who are based in New Zealand, and eventually it'll be further afield but for now, I feel like there is hundreds of stories over here that I want to share. So I'm just going to start with them and then I'm just going to see how this kind of goes and grows and based on the feedback from you guys as the listeners. I will I guess pivot the direction of things as and when needed  so the interviews or what I would like to refer to them as chats because I do not like the idea of me just sitting there and dictating the conversation. I feel like these women that are going to be on the podcast have got some awesome stories and the purpose of this podcast is for you to listen and connect with these women. It's so easy to get caught up in your own head about your own business and look onto these people through social media and through
6:  Glimpse of it. You take a snapshot line. And this is again. Like we're going to get into a big conversation about like body positivity through your body connectivity as a better word through motherhood the transition of into motherhood because that's like something I'm so fucking passionate about and that's like work I'ma blow your goddamn minds, but give yourself time. Give yourself time be gentle go slow be interested.  Curious. Yes be curious and get it with yourself before you bring in another human. Yep, right like we didn't really get it with yourself before you bring in another human in. This was my approach this time as well where I was very mindful in because I experienced prolapse this time around which is a whole new whole new fucking Terrain in the pussy department where I
7:  Bus for this video is not for the person who had the kind of mom who considers her children the heartbeat outside of her body. This video is not for the listener who plans on buying their mama Mansion when they make it this video is not for that kind of mom, but this video is for my listeners who have been damaged who have been neglected who are resentful of their mothers who have been misinformed about their worth from their mothers and this video is for women who have grown up with a  Three dysfunctional example of motherhood and this video is for my followers who recognize that they may be at a point in their lives where they realize that they have to repair a lot of damage. Now everyone who has experienced toxicity with their mothers has a different story. Sometimes the damage that is done is mild. Sometimes the damage is moderate and sometimes the damage is on a yalla yalla fix my life.

Topic 32 giants game december 22: I want to hear about the NY-Washington NFL football game played on December 22, 2019.  Why was the game important?  What were people saying leading up to it?  What was the outcome?  How did it affect the NFL postseason?
[2174, 4240, 2374, 4603, 2175, 514, 2238, 2112, 515, 4239]
0:  Red River rivalry Red River rivalry Red River rivalry, I'm killing it bro killing. Are you got it? You got it. Well, since you're killing it I'ma let you go ahead and pick a I'm let you pick this up you always on the Texas game on now, come on now. Yeah, you know what? This is a fun game arguably a me in my opinion. I think this game has the most potential be the most fun to watch actually this week. I think when you come to Big Twelve matchups, especially Big 12 rivalries, I think that this game will be a high-scoring game. I think it could be very entertaining.  I think if you look at the seniors, I think they're gonna have a lot of adversity to deal with for the first time and I think Texas will play them a very good football game. Obviously. The Sooners offense has been exploding you got Jalen Hurd some Lincoln Riley leading the way they did some incredible things to this point haven't really played anybody that special obviously up to this point a lot of people been saying that at this point the season because you know going back to what we talked about before with scheduling. There's been some teams that haven't really scheduled tough opponents to their first five games, but obviously each year your team will route
1:  Name his rotation in his minutes and a snap counts were down a little bit. So he felt a lot better this week. So that's a good sign. And another thing, you know, the forest Buckner, you know, he's he's been on the on these bad night. Our team's he's seen what happens in Seattle. He had enough of it last year versus Seahawks at home and he put his stamp all over that game the December 16th game last year in San Francisco in the Niners pulled out the win. He sounded very much the same after the Rams game.  Mmmmmm speaking about the Seahawks like it did last year bunker knows how the importance of this game and I think Buckner is going to put his stamp on this game this week and you know, finally hopefully get this streak over in Seattle. Yeah, you know, I real quick. I want to touch on something that it was pointed out to me that Marshawn Lynch coming back for the for the Seahawks. I believe it was two weeks ago when we were in Santa Clara for the Falcons game Marshawn Lynch.
2:  Yeah, it was that was the most incredible part. And the other thing I want to say about this game that I remember is everyone say DMACC was good. And I remember wanting him in prison because Brandon Marshall took his lunch all game long and they almost lost the game because of it. Yeah, this this defense was completely fucking deplorable people people might want to sugarcoat it you got the Sports Talk. Josè of the world saying that, you know Brady's never carried a defense to a  To a Super Bowl anything that's complete bullshit. The 2011 pads defense was an absolute joke. It was an absolute joke week one on they needed to Kyle Arrington interception to you know, basically seal this game, which is indefensible. Right a quarterback throws for 500 plus yards. You should win the fucking football game and somehow the outcome at the end was still not quite in doubt, but kind of in doubt, you know, and yeah, this was just
3:  On this Premier League head of coaching course last December December 2018 first and foremost again. I don't know the specifics. I don't know him as a person. I don't know the Dynamics. I don't want to talk from anything. But first and foremost, you obviously have to say to be in this sort of hot water being head of coaching knowing how diverse football is and how inclusive it is and especially Crystal Palace. Like I don't really know south of the River South London. I'm going north boy, but isn't that crazy?  Raiden Fulton, he find them sighs. They're very diverse and Multicultural backgrounds. So it displaying ignorance again, if he did make this comment whoever he did whoever it was I sympathize with the victim and whatnot, but it preaches ignorance and in a club like football, I mean a club like Crystal Palace that is a very close close ties to the community just a Premier League club in 20 in the 21st century or just in 2019 really almost in 2020. This isn't what you want to hear now again, I don't want to
4:  I think if you look at the seniors, I think they're gonna have a lot of adversity to deal with for the first time and I think Texas will play them a very good football game. Obviously. The Sooners offense has been exploding you got Jalen Hurd some Lincoln Riley leading the way they did some incredible things to this point haven't really played anybody that special obviously up to this point a lot of people been saying that at this point the season because you know going back to what we talked about before with scheduling. There's been some teams that haven't really scheduled tough opponents to their first five games, but obviously each year your team will route  Reach This crucial Point like Oklahoma has now they play a pretty good team and you're going to see what they're made of and I think Texas is going to push Oklahoma a little bit in this game and you know more than that. I think I Linger on the o is going to keep control the clock like they've done all year. I think they're really good at that. I think, you know with a few empty drives though that they might come up with I think Oklahoma is going to start press and hurts my good under pressure from that longhorn defensive front. I'll be back and forth throughout the whole game, but I think in the fourth quarter, I think Oklahoma is just going to turn it on I
5:  he's got good brain that talk about Tom Brady that's why I like in the first hour you heard me like backing off of betting on the Titans it's like I don't know of mad because it's so hard to go against everything inside you that says this is the Patriots this is still Tom Brady this is no Bill Belichick in this is still the playoffs but Mike Vrabel willing to do anything whatever it takes to win that's an intriguing game this week yeah there's that side of then there's a side like that your eyes see all year long like this offense it stinks it's not  News came out yesterday the to ah Tong of Allah. That's right. Yeah right there to atone. Villa will make his announcement on whether he's going back to Alabama or going to the NFL on January 6th. Just a year ago. People were saying that the Alabama football team could beat an NFL team because of how good to a was as a quarterback. People are saying that now those people obviously we all know
6:  And then look and they play not even just the winners because for example, that's how I got to find to find the exit because I didn't know it even existed. But when I saw that it won this award and they people saying it's a really fun game really easy game to teach that got me to buy it because the Spiel Des jahres itself gave it an award. So something sculptures is the first time I'm hearing that except one. Sorry, but I own the games.  Well, I didn't hear I did hear that there is there was a little debate regarding Dixit being nominated because many gamers consider it more of a party game than more game and he gave a description. That was good.
7:  the FBS but there's been some pretty good, you know players that come out of the FCS. I go play NFL football and they're great athletes and great players, you know, that could be something in the game that's overlooked is Stefan Hodges. He could, you know show up and play really well, but like you said, I just think there's you can't trust that it's hard to trust that especially on the road against the same. You know, I almost sent San Diego Chargers that Los Angeles Chargers and you know, I think the bolts just have you know, it's time for them to kind of  Put up and you know, they have a lot of time on that team you have so many weapons. I think Rivers needs to play really well in this game because you struggled a lot last week. I think to be a close game Sunday night matchup and I'm going to take the bullets in this one. So it's nice. That's our NFL picks for this week. We're going to come back at you with some college football news and takes you all stay around stay around guys. Thanks for joining us.
8:  News came out yesterday the to ah Tong of Allah. That's right. Yeah right there to atone. Villa will make his announcement on whether he's going back to Alabama or going to the NFL on January 6th. Just a year ago. People were saying that the Alabama football team could beat an NFL team because of how good to a was as a quarterback. People are saying that now those people obviously we all know  No now January 2nd 2020 are buffoons the things that a college football team to beat an NFL team, but that's what to a did to the football sporting world. He captivated everybody in the football World this little Lefty from the island comes over to Alabama in his freshman season comes in at halftime plays hero wins a national championship goes on to be a disgustingly talented quarterback and then this year yet again the same conversation.
9:  But what you saw from Travis Homer last week is not going to cut it in pass protection when you're trying to help Russell out there. So the defensive line needs to get after it this week. This is what you get paid for. This is why you go and draft a Nick bow. So now if the for was playing I feel even better about it just because the Ford has that first quickstep and he would be able to I think handles fetty pretty well off the right side and I think the rotation help them out a lot last week to you stalk. You spoke not you spoke, but they spoke to Nick Bosa after the  Name his rotation in his minutes and a snap counts were down a little bit. So he felt a lot better this week. So that's a good sign. And another thing, you know, the forest Buckner, you know, he's he's been on the on these bad night. Our team's he's seen what happens in Seattle. He had enough of it last year versus Seahawks at home and he put his stamp all over that game the December 16th game last year in San Francisco in the Niners pulled out the win. He sounded very much the same after the Rams game.
 
Topic 33 hvac industry environmentalism: What is the HVAC industry doing to promote sustainability and “green” technology?  Has it been effective?  What is the effect on people working in the industry?
[1643, 1642, 4033, 4034, 5126, 2195, 1599, 73, 4447, 1598]
0:  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but  So the deal is he came in so my new operation super excited about it. He always look I get a lot of Consulting from a lot of people. Some of them are friends of them charge me. Some of them just come from books some of them podcast, but he came in flew into town wanted to hang out show them my place showed him. My plan showed him. My pll's my balance sheet and he said hey you're losing. It wasn't $150,000 in these four markets. He goes. Can I just take a guess on what's going on?
1:  Things in a day because they're so busy putting out fires. They don't understand the tax laws her amazing right now and how to really I'm not saying don't pay your taxes, but there are certain things you could do to pay less taxes, you know, this is fun for me. But yeah there I just went on and on about you ask me a simple question. It's me. Yeah. There's you were in the Atlanta Market here. I saw one of your trucks. Are you guys still here you guys move out?  Out so there's four markets. I got out of it and basically here's the story. I had a guy coming to town. He's a buddy of mine. He does about 75 million a year. They're there in growth mode. He'll probably be by the end of the year 200 million because they're acquiring companies and this is a garage door guy in the HVAC industry of no one's doing that in the garage door industry. There's a couple franchises but
2:  It sounds like a cliche but like I actually didn't know anyone. I didn't have a lot of money because like working in India. I was getting paid like three hundred dollars a month, right? So I had no savings and I got there and fortunately I had a couple of friends there who were also studying in different Fashions. You technology other institute's so we kind of just rented and studio apartment between like three people in Manhattan because that's all we could afford and like I  I'll think that was the best decision I ever took in that the school and the program was so carefully curated and the and the you know practitioners and the people that I studied with are people that I still aren't, you know called my advisors and people who are my tribe and you know, they are the people who were actually working in the industry during the day and coming to teach us during the evening. So they were so cute in to what what was needed at that industry because a lot of times in Academia you have people who are
3:  I'll think that was the best decision I ever took in that the school and the program was so carefully curated and the and the you know practitioners and the people that I studied with are people that I still aren't, you know called my advisors and people who are my tribe and you know, they are the people who were actually working in the industry during the day and coming to teach us during the evening. So they were so cute in to what what was needed at that industry because a lot of times in Academia you have people who are  So far divorced from what's the reality of the industry that you don't really when you get out there's too much affection between what is needed and what you were taught? Absolutely. Yeah that I mean we should the state of education is a really interesting kind of side tangent. But before that, I'd love to just hear a little bit more about what
4:  In the AV industry people have the heart and sweat in it. It's their passion. It was really cool to see when I came over that people really had an inches and wanted to meet with you and want to see what technology is coming out on what Panasonic's having to offer compared to what they've seen out there in the world and come to tree chosen her very intrigued and learning it and they and the passion kind of grew on me to learn more about my products and to be a trusted advisor on  Side and listen to my clients and learn more from my clients in my Engineers that I could ever know. I tell clients sometimes, you know the product better and I do probably on the ins and outs and in the form of it of how they actually get to the color wheel and getting colors out and I'm sure there's a lot guys. I talked to that know a lot more than me in this and I'm not afraid to admit it and that's what that's kind of really created the excitement for me and working this industry.
5:  Getting yourself to a position where you're becoming the most effective version of you. Like I said, this is what this podcast is all about and over the next coming days weeks. Hopefully even years of success of with this podcast. I'm going to be sharing those tips tricks and hacks. I'm also going to be bringing people on to the podcast that are being effective at the highest level, whether that's some of the most effective Fitness coaches in the industry, whether that's effective business people whether that's some of my own clients or people. I know that have a crazy amazing incredible transformations.  I'm going to be bringing them to this podcast. So you can hear stories from other people that if you don't buy it from me, if you don't get it from me that you can be motivated and make a change. Maybe the you're going to get that from someone else. So on the next few episodes, I'm going to be interviewing. Like I said some of the best in the industry and the fitness industry getting them to share with us what's allowed them to become a fitness executive themself? Because it was only yesterday. I was listening to someone else's podcast where a multi-millionaire I'm talking. This guy's net worth was a hundred and
6:  Life will be just one more on that and it's something again, which is quite close to my heart with talked about the general industries that are out there one of the industries which doesn't get thought about of burnout is people in the professions of been lawyers and solicitors that the pressure that these people under and working with a couple of colleagues of mine that there's a performance club which is based at looking at senior leaders that have gone through these two burnouts as we call them and being open to talk about what's happened to them. So it affects every industry no in dresses and  immune to it. If you think you're working in a small company you still as vulnerable as a large company very true indeed. I'm very fine words from York live on that and Heather the takeaway is that we're looking at from Podium podcast today. I'd thank you very much for your openness. Both of you in terms of what you've personally been through and I can see the takeaway is a very employees need to have trust in both their managers and in culture within the business. So it's key for the company culture to be open with the environment for survival and empowering.
7:  I can you know, I definitely worked really closely with screenwriters and visual artists and filmmakers like yeah. Mmm would what would you say is your advice to a teenager that wants to work in the entertainment industry as a manager or run their own business in the entertainment industry. They moved to Los Angeles and go get a job at Starbucks start interning as much nonsense.  And meeting people and working for free and if they tell you that they don't take interns just tell them that you'll you'll do whatever they need. And if they tell you something you don't know how to do tell them that you'll figure it out and then Google it or ask somebody else and just get it done because that's is all a manager does is get it done. All the only job is to make sure it gets done and if you can do that eventually people start paying for it and just be nice to people like if you're nice and you
8: Then so she's the founder of a new booking agency called Delia bookings. So we're going to find out a little bit about what was the inspiration behind setting up this new business what your take is on the music industry here and versus the UK. So without further Ado where you from and what exactly brought you to Amsterdam. Where am I from Wow, as you can see? Yeah my dulcet tones. I'm from the north of England lived in London for  About 11 nearly 12 years on and off yells came to Amsterdam three years ago. And what brought me here was so I've been working in the music industry. I mean, yeah, I'm going to say probably like after graduation, right? So I graduated from a music degree and since 2008. So been working in the industry since then and I came over for a job to lead the marketing for a streaming service. So my forte I guess booking agency.
9:  Site, particularly for managers. They've got really good resources their campaign against living miserably calm very interesting interesting organization as well. Obviously anybody that's really struggling. There's a Samaritans and then finally given that my big thing is personal responsibility. I think reading books such as the inner chimp really interesting learning about how our brains work. We do not understand enough about how we work as an as human beings and the more that we start to understand that the more richer experiences of  Life will be just one more on that and it's something again, which is quite close to my heart with talked about the general industries that are out there one of the industries which doesn't get thought about of burnout is people in the professions of been lawyers and solicitors that the pressure that these people under and working with a couple of colleagues of mine that there's a performance club which is based at looking at senior leaders that have gone through these two burnouts as we call them and being open to talk about what's happened to them. So it affects every industry no in dresses and

Okay bunny ears. I'll give you that. It's a little more acceptable on Halloween, but it's also not that much like a basic Friday night is not much better than like Halloween, you know what I mean? Like what I wear on a Friday night is not more slutty than I would wear on Halloween probably think so. Well, I also don't dress up like that.

4:  It within the wheel of the year. So this holiday is actually celebrated on October 31st. Some people will prefer to celebrate it on November 1st, but it really just depends on your preference and it actually has a lot of ties with Halloween. I think that Halloween was rooted in this celebration, obviously, you know this came prior to Halloween the modern-day Halloween, I guess I should say but  It is kind of similar and thought and you can see a lot of themes brought into like the modern conception of Halloween. So it is one of the two nights where the veil between the worlds are lifted. So the the contact with the spirits are way easier and it really is a good time to work on your divination skills.
5:  Grave a place where a dead person or animal is buried. All right. Now listen closely here is an article for you that has some different expressions and idioms contained inside.  Halloween is celebrated in different ways around the world. But no matter where you celebrate it Halloween is about finding ways to have fun with scary things. So here are some fun and useful Expressions that are a little scary.
6:  So like I was saying, you know, people are not understanding the information they are feeding their subconscious. And if you just obtaining information with a shitload of blockages was the point of the information. What's the point? What was the point of you digging for that in piece of information, you know, if you don't understand it now when you have blockages  And you seek information you're basically looking for information that's going to justify your fixated perspective on your personal reality and people need to understand that, you know, it's right here and there and then that you have to like acknowledge like, you know, you have to ask yourself. Am I looking for information? That is the universal truth or am I looking for information that's going to justify.
7:  Halloween is celebrated in different ways around the world. But no matter where you celebrate it Halloween is about finding ways to have fun with scary things. So here are some fun and useful Expressions that are a little scary.  A skeleton in the closet a person with a skeleton in the closet has a secret. That would make them look bad. If someone found out about it, for example, you could say too many politicians have skeletons in their closets give up the ghost. If a person gives up the ghost. It means they died if an object or machine.
8:  And you seek information you're basically looking for information that's going to justify your fixated perspective on your personal reality and people need to understand that, you know, it's right here and there and then that you have to like acknowledge like, you know, you have to ask yourself. Am I looking for information? That is the universal truth or am I looking for information that's going to justify.  This small fragment of reality. This does basically concealed within a box, right and that's blockages right there, you know, and and this is the cause of so much ignorance and hatred around the world, you know what I'm saying? And and there's a lot of people out here that there are egotistical when it comes to information and they think they know everything and they're just burning a bunch of ignorance, you know, and and there
9:  have passed on from this world and have gone to the next and it kind of celebrates the end of Summer and the coming of like the winter months. They use the kind of analogy of that. There's the Sun God and the Earth are falling into Slumber and as you know, the days are getting shorter the nights begin to lengthen until we get to the longest day of the year, which is the winter solstice which is another holiday. That is  It within the wheel of the year. So this holiday is actually celebrated on October 31st. Some people will prefer to celebrate it on November 1st, but it really just depends on your preference and it actually has a lot of ties with Halloween. I think that Halloween was rooted in this celebration, obviously, you know this came prior to Halloween the modern-day Halloween, I guess I should say but

We're going to set some families free from their debt and we're going to free them so that they can get on with their lives isn't that amazing that we can do that but then he went on to tell me that one of the saddest things I've ever heard and I said, so that's that's amazing. He says but pasta Richard you realize that some people having been slaves will then go back.  And take out another debt and enslave themselves again. And how many of us think that's Madness. Why would you do that? I think Kevin would say the same thing to all of us having been set free. Why would you become a slave again to a certain area of your life my life? Come on, let me set free from something. Let's stay free in Jesus name. Come on. Let's give him a shout in this place. I love that.
3:  That's what some will tell you. No for everyone.  First Timothy 2 6 a ransom for all if I paid your Ransom you're free from that debt and your disbelief won't change a thing. A ransom was owed a ransom was paid if you don't believe it. So what it's true. If you believe it it's true. If you don't your belief changes, nothing a sin debt was owed a sin debt was paid sins are not the issue. So move on with it spend your time getting others saved instead of arguing with those who already are
4:  And with what that's like so for me again, like we go back to the student loan thing. The the goal for me is to receive a paycheck and to know I can give invest and spend and Save in a way that is radical and I want to know what that feeling is like that freedom of optionality is amazing. And that's a huge emotional connection to me. That's my dream is living a debt free life. The goals are to pay down the student loan.  And the actionable steps to take our take any extra dollar that I have outside of a savings net and boom I dump it in there when those three things are aligned you are unstoppable. So guys as we come to a close today, we've gone over those 10 steps. We're gonna have a 31-page, you know, goal-setting PDF that Steven himself has created. It's totally free. Feel free to download that and we'll tune in next week for episode 2. Have a great day guys.
5:  So what does that mean? These people never get out and families this not just a family for one generation the second generation. Sometimes the third generation are stuck in that brick-making slave Kiln area for their whole lives children grow up. They don't they don't go to school. So Pastor John's Ministry for $1000 they go there and they pay the debt to the owner and they set those people free and he showed me photos. Isn't that amazing?  Chuck if it's okay with you guys later on this year. We're gonna raise some money. We're going to set some families free from their debt and we're going to free them so that they can get on with their lives isn't that amazing that we can do that but then he went on to tell me that one of the saddest things I've ever heard and I said, so that's that's amazing. He says but pasta Richard you realize that some people having been slaves will then go back.
6:  First Timothy 2 6 a ransom for all if I paid your Ransom you're free from that debt and your disbelief won't change a thing. A ransom was owed a ransom was paid if you don't believe it. So what it's true. If you believe it it's true. If you don't your belief changes, nothing a sin debt was owed a sin debt was paid sins are not the issue. So move on with it spend your time getting others saved instead of arguing with those who already are  Stop wasting your time and silly Facebook groups. There's a real war going on out here, but some are only interested in Friendly Fire.
7:  Now what I like about the debt snowball method is that it helps you build little victories you get little winds you gained momentum after each debt is paid off and benefit psychologically. My wife and I are living examples of how effective the debt snowball method can be in becoming debt free in achieving Financial Independence Financial Freedom. So, let's see how the debt snowball method works first. You're going to list all your debts.  Smallest amount to the largest amount so I'm talking about credit cards student loans, you know mortgage. Whatever you have list all your debts the Second Step pay the minimum on all the debts. Okay. Try to get enough income where you can pay the minimum on all the debts number three.

Topic 36 cryptocurrency risks: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies?  Many people are talking about cryptocurrency as an investment and it seems to have many benefits.  Are there any drawbacks?  What are they?  What setbacks have people suffered when investing in cryptocurrencies?
[1478, 4662, 4661, 1461, 4668, 1404, 1460, 1462, 4666, 4667]
0:  So there it is the fundamentals of crypto. We've learned what it is what problems in might solve and how people around the world are using it. Now remember it's still quite volatile, but nevertheless what if you're interested in buying it for yourself or looking at it as an investment, you'll have, you know, six months in a row of Bitcoin up every month and it feels like a risk free trade. It's easy right just happens every month you make money and then people start getting greedy. That's alright Paul managing partner blocked our capital a hedge fund focused on investing.  In cryptocurrencies will be talking to him in the next episode and will be learning the investment side of crypto.
1:  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait  Wait lists go through some complex. Use I that's tailored to a traitor not till like an ordinary consumer. And the worst part about it is you can't just buy cryptocurrency with a credit card or US Dollars. You have to actually bring cryptocurrency from somewhere else used it to get cryptocurrency. Well, this is way too much to ask for an ordinary person to get through.
2:  Hey guys, it's great to be here.  In developed economies 70% of people know about cryptocurrency and yet only 5% own any there is a tremendous Market gap between awareness and adoption and there is a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on that if we can just get to the core of why that Gap exists to get most cryptocurrencies. You have to find your way to an obscure exchange. You have to probably wait
3:  People doing bad things. It's all of the other people too. But you're kind of seeing all the same people that made mobile work. You're saying all the same people that made social networking work. You're seeing all the same people that made the internet work or early PCS work. So yes, there are some people here that are doing some bad things but there are a lot of other people here too. Now that we have a good understanding of Bitcoin. What about some of the other cryptocurrencies out there? And actually what's the difference between a cryptocurrency and a crypto asset crypto assets is sort of the more  odd term because there are certain types of crypto assets which are not necessarily currencies because one of the properties that you need of a currency is that it's fungible right like a dollar is a dollar and so Bitcoin is effectively a Bitcoin and they're interchangeable. Whereas for something like a Pokemon go card, you might have two different types of Pokémon cards. And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between
4:  And to make cryptocurrency Within Reach for anybody. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So let's walk through what's on that key? Sure. So I order that key. Yeah. And is that electronic wallet on there? And then you update it electronically. She's gonna drive right? This is the scores you USB drive. And for those of you who aren't familiar cryptocurrencies have wallets and that's what describes a private key.  That gives you the credentials to sell cryptocurrency and a wallet is really just that grip that the private key. Okay, but I buy that you send it to me at five cryptocurrencies is the five top market caps. So like unicorny 3000 top 100. Yeah, that's okay. So you get top 100. I bought five you send me it and there's 50 bucks on there. We have packages of different packages. Okay. Now I got the key. Yes. Okay. Now what do I do with it? Great. So we have clients who?
5:  Survive in such a bad economy. And one of the ways I survived is with cryptocurrencies with such bad inflation. It'd be crazy to keep his wealth entirely in believe ours. So in that case you're using your bolivars to purchase Bitcoin and then holding Bitcoin instead of the Bolivar. A lot of people are doing that. But because of my work I don't actually earn in local currency. I write and I get paid in Bitcoin or in cryptocurrency simply.  Because of thanks to our currency controls. I cannot have bank accounts in in dollars is simply not legally Can Only Hold local currency. So cryptocurrencies are away from me to bypass all of these restrictions and actually get paid for my work and can you give us can you share? What is your daily routine look like when you're you know shopping for food or paying expenses or paying rent. How does that work for you? So in that a lot of people accept Bitcoin directly, so
6:  Out what should and shouldn't work you do often see drug dealers because they have a lot of friction to using existing Technologies and their willingness to adopt new technologies might give them an edge and their business and they're willing to take the risks to have an edge. You'll see the adult entertainment industry adopt things very early. So you start enumerating like who in the history of technology is usually an early adopter and you sort of come up with the same groups of people over and over again, and what's fascinating about Bitcoin is it's not just the sort of people on the fringes in terms of  People doing bad things. It's all of the other people too. But you're kind of seeing all the same people that made mobile work. You're saying all the same people that made social networking work. You're seeing all the same people that made the internet work or early PCS work. So yes, there are some people here that are doing some bad things but there are a lot of other people here too. Now that we have a good understanding of Bitcoin. What about some of the other cryptocurrencies out there?

And so they're not exactly interchangeable and are not fungible and so the cryptocurrency sort of a subset of a crypto asset what are other examples of cryptocurrencies that you would assume would be a little bit more mainstream. What is the difference between  Didn't Bitcoin like how did those even come to be? Yeah, so there are three categories of cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin that we think about there are things that are actually more decentralized even that Bitcoin and a lot of these are where people who have deep academic background in distributed systems and cryptography have come into the space in the last several years and created you can almost think of them as new and better Bitcoin. And so for example, there are some projects like space mesh.
8:  We acquire five cryptocurrencies for you out of the top 100 by market cap. We secure them using military-grade encryption on this device. This is a c block.  And it is the starter kit To Join the cryptocurrency Revolution. So we launched a pilot and in 30 days. We generated sales of more than thirty thousand dollars. We had International interests shipping to customers in eight countries on five continents. And so we're doing a seed round to launch our product in Canada.

1:  Number two travel differently instead of visiting three new cities in five days choose to visit only one city this way. You can gradually immerse yourself into the culture and experience the nuances of daily life. This idea of a length in cultural. Immersion has been dubbed slow travel the method suggests. We linger in one place to really get the feel for it and take the time to learn the rhymes of local life without rushing from one tourist destination to the next you can even spend time doing nothing to allow for restful.  Contemplation of the travel experience slow travel allows us to foster a stronger connection to the place where visiting allows us a nice break from our fast-paced daily life.

I truly believe if we want to be a sustainable Society then we need to make sure each soul is successful and what I mean by successful is I mean happy and living in alignment with their soul mission.

We love we need to show up and do the work and change our vibration because our vibration is the world's vibration to me. This is what holistic health looks like on a global scale sustainable Souls create a sustainable society, which
8:  Reading is a slower activity than speaking and listening conversations move very fast. And sometimes it's difficult to keep up with conversational style of learning reading is slow and because of that you can move at your own pace to learn the language that you're trying to learn. So if you're reading a book and you come across a word that you don't know you can stop reading pull out a dictionary look in the dictionary. Learn the word be like, oh I learned a new word.  And then continue with your book in conversation. You hear the word your brain might not might not even register and how the word was said and you're confused like oh, what was that word? I think I don't know it and by the time you even think that I want to ask them what that word is, you know, the person might have already moved on or you might not have heard the word correctly enough to repeat a back and say what does that word mean? Like it's so fast, right? It's so fast. So reading I like the fact that it's a slower activity and you can really
9:  My gosh, I'm 39 million families travel every year for Thanksgiving all of the people traveling by car drive an average of 588 miles producing ten point eight billion total pounds of CO2. That's if they're traveling by car, correct and all of the people traveling by plane fly an average of 500 Miles producing 800 million pounds of CO2. So it's worse to fly. Oh, yeah.  Right travel by flying. So would it be better if let's say you have a relative and like Wisconsin, but it'd be better if they drove to see you then if they like flew to see you or should they just not see you at all?
 
Topic 38 workplace diversity: What are things companies are doing and could do to promote diversity in the workplace?  Things like workplace programs, initiatives, education, and outreach are relevant.  Discussion about the outcomes of these efforts are relevant as well.
[4448, 4494, 4449, 3823, 3822, 490, 1118, 4491, 30, 94]
0:  You're working in your workplace as a representative of God as a slave you recognize that God is the one who is granting you success.  So if you are thinking about how you can glorify God in the workplace here is some things you can do that will allow you to glorify guys in the replace one is
1:  And sometimes you think to yourself also provide that I'm doing my best for you in the workplace.  Why is this thing that is happening to me? Why doesn't it seem fair?
2:  So if you are thinking about how you can glorify God in the workplace here is some things you can do that will allow you to glorify guys in the replace one is  Here with everyone lovingly still with everyone lovingly not a romance. I will have no office visits on
3:  I might find my knee relevant. I might find this are relevant. I might find right the fact that it's a particular day in May relevant. Do you see what I'm showing you the class of things we find relevant is not homogeneous other than we finding them relevant. There is nothing that they share it's exactly like the class of white things.  What about stable? So when I find something relevant do I always find it relevant? This is relevant to me now. Well it forever be relevant to me. I will care Cairo. It is relevant know things are not stable irrelevant.
4:  What do they share in common? I might find this pain relevant.  I might find my knee relevant. I might find this are relevant. I might find right the fact that it's a particular day in May relevant. Do you see what I'm showing you the class of things we find relevant is not homogeneous other than we finding them relevant. There is nothing that they share it's exactly like the class of white things.
5:  Your metaphor. No. No, you're not. It's I always say representation still matters, right? So they're still as a piece of diversity where you know, I don't believe in Quota systems, but I also believe you just have to you have to see it to believe it. So if you're going to say you're a diverse and inclusive community or Workforce, but there's no one who's a woman or identified as a woman that I can see that's representing then I'm not sure I would believe someone you know, so I think that those two things still play very close together.  Now, I mean you obviously talked with a lot of individuals and organizations and you're involved with different community outreach programs and conferences. What do you feel are the most pressing topics of discussion in the diversity inclusion world right now, I think for me some of the more pressing conversations to be honest our conversations that we've been having for quite some time, but I do think
6:  Millisecond assumptions and decisions that you're making right and then in the workplace you're making them about people right? And so that's when we can run we run into problems. And so when I talk about unconscious bias, I actually frame it as a sort of interpersonal discrimination. So we have no way of structural discrimination around like practices and policies but interpersonal discrimination occurs between two people and the way that they can affect us is that it can influence who gets hired.  How we get evaluated at work, which leaders are selected at work who is promoted at work? And so obviously it's something especially as women of color we should know about because it can impede our progress in the workplace. So some things that you know educate people about an organization's about is to have more structured processes or protocols in place, like for example, during an interview. It's really important to have it a structured set of questions as opposed to those off-the-cuff interviews.
7:  Someone acting with real Integrity someone giving his best effort.  Someone who was doing all he can to glorify God within the workplace.
8:  City it's kind of like saying we will only accept lesbians, you know into our business like we will only focus on helping dyslexics will let me help focus on lesbians. I'm not saying anyone's ever done that but it's kind of the same concept. It's like you're picking one stream as opposed to understanding how the neuro-diverse brain works how the what we call the right side has or the right brain works and looking at how you helped that group because  The commonalities and the challenges between dyslexia ADHD Etc are very similar, you know, there are people that are more extreme but in general the general population have very similar challenges and work places just to not set up for it. There's a great interview. I did with Rich who's doing some work around the neuro diversity badge and workplaces and New Zealand and he's going to hopefully take it worldwide. It's such a great concept where companies actually learn what neuro diversity is and actually how
9:  A mere show come from yeah. It was like all a dream. I think you look came up with the name and she thinks I came up with the name. Jeanne came up with a name. So what it is, we're brainstorming names and we're trying to come up with things that aren't sexist. The one that was the most like tongue-in-cheek that I thought was funny was Battlestar hysterical initially Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace was like the tag under the title. So it would be you know Battlestar hysterical Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace and  We kept saying this over and over and I was like, oh, it's just the tag and I was like, it just needs a sing-song under it's like Battle Tactics for your 6 is workplace and then no and so I recorded that and I sent that to Jeannie because I woke up the next morning and I was like, why did you listen me a voice memo it like one o'clock in the morning and it was you singing Battle Tactics for your sexist workplace. And I was like, that's all we need. We just need people to be able to Google it. You know, I think it's something really valuable in the name that it's just google-able.
 
Topic 39 social media marketing: I’m looking for tips and suggestions for creating a social media marketing strategy.  What kinds of things do I need to think about?  How can I reach the most people online?  Are there companies that can help?
[28, 535, 534, 27, 202, 203, 3268, 543, 29, 910]
0:  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and
1:  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.  Has long been debated in our survey found that those social media is key to a marketing strategy 19 percent of marketers are still uncertain as to how to measure its Effectiveness. Right and a part of me thinks that there will always be an element of uncertainty to social media dark social as they call it. It's honestly nearly impossible to truly measure and Report the impact that brand awareness from social media has on the bottom line, but think about the trillions of private messages shares comments likes views and so much more that happened every single day.
2:  On social media, but it really hasn't come to fruition yet. So we'll see how that plays out this year. Yes, we will.  Now that we've talked about some specifics. Let's take a step back and cover the results from a higher level first. Is that social media is a key part of many Brands marketing strategies yet nearly 20 percent are unsure how to measure Effectiveness, right? So social media marketing has been around for many years now and the majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall strategy 58 percent of marketers say social media is very important while 30% say it's somewhat important social media is Effectiveness as a marketing channel.
3:  Before you take somebody on to help you with your social media. It's just one example, but get that it's I always think it's like you wouldn't get in a car without having a map or knowing where you're going. So it's just get that strategy right invest in that and then you'll be off and flying and it will make such a difference to your income and your business. Yeah, and I agree. Like I think marketing is probably the biggest area that people struggle with that and mindset but they don't realize the mindset is actually impacting them the way it is, but with marketing I  Whenever I put surveys out and ask people what's the number one thing they want to help with it's always marketing and getting themselves out there. So given this is your area of expertise. What would you say or what are your top tips for people looking for help with marketing their businesses? Yeah. So I guess first of all is just think about your overall business goals. First of all, so don't just jump in and think I've got a spread myself really thin and be on every social media platform and that's going to grow.
4:  X I was telling people anything except for a tech startup which we all know better than to say that because that's where I ended up. So yeah that the full Journey I'm working at it. Now. I'm working to Tech startup that is in the film world. So there you go started with the CPA firm in Kansas all the way to this. Yeah. It's quit the quite the journey. I don't know. That's all you wanted to know. But yeah your listeners to know that I'm not full of crap.  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.
5:  There you go. Awesome. Well today we're talking about video strategy and kind of the overall higher level thinking of it comes to video and marketing. So let's start with kind of a basic why is developing a video strategy so important? Yeah. Well, I think just for clarity for anyone out there that's you know, either running their own company or leveraging video as a marketing tactic. I think it's really important to distinguish between a marketing strategy and a video marketing strategy.  She and I think that's important because if the only thing you're doing is focusing on the medium, which is video. It won't work for you. Like it's not going to deliver what you're hoping. It's going to deliver at some point. It's going to feel an authentic here audience. It's going to kind of fall flat in terms of measurable. Like hey this actually increase their bottom line. I hope to stay home or whatever like whatever you're hoping video will do it will not if you're putting all of your weight just on the medium.
6:  And to say there's when you're trying to be an influencer or work with the brand, I think you have to look at it as a business relationship and understand that there are things need to mesh up and there's some things that you need to be aware of just like the brand needs to be aware of so that everybody could make an effective relationship. Absolutely. I really as a business owner small business owner myself when I launched my marketing company, I had no idea that I would evolve into  Your marketing. So at this point social media is quite literally the absolute basic thing that I do for my clients influencer marketing is where it's at whether it's a client that decides they just want product placed with influencers that are already on my list and people that I follow that I know are genuine or there, you know ongoing clients for whom I do social media when I'm running things like affiliate programs I have to vet
7:  Engagement and traffic but I think that engagement or just a good overall indicator of quality of that. Yeah, cool. Yeah. The last data point I wanted to share is that the vast majority of marketers 85% use third-party tools like buffer to support the social media marketing tools can help you to streamline your workflows help you to save time and even ensure your content reaches the Right audience as the right at the right time absolutely tools are arguably more important than ever with the amount of outgoing and incoming volume brands are  These days so lots of brands are using social media as a customer service tool as well as for amplification and just a little bit more about the 1800 marketers that took our survey 49 percent of the people who took our survey work at companies with fewer than 10 full-time staff a further 20.5% work at companies with between 11 to 50 full-time members and about twenty three percent of marketers work at companies with over a hundred employees. And in terms of marketing team size the majority of respondents in our survey.
8:  My business think about what your tangible goals are that you want to achieve with your business. Then you can translate those goals into an overarching marketing strategy. So maybe you don't even need to be on some of these social media channels. I would say you definitely don't if you're just starting out just pick one or two and commit to those have you thought about email marketing. Have you thought about traditional forms of marketing networking all that kind of stuff that's really important to look at the strategy before you invest any time and  Jion money into the specific elements. That would be a kind of top tip for me as get right first thing. That's so important as I think that's the thing. It's like everybody like a headless chicken. Yeah, and I think that's a big is that we try to do all the things and then when you try and do everything it just is a total mess and disaster and you wonder why you're not getting anywhere near side. Yeah. They also monitor obviously. So once you have decided once you've got your strategy in place and you've committed

Topic 40 bees dying: There have been numerous news reports of bees and other pollinators dying. I want to learn what I can do personally to help bees and other pollinators. General discussions about habitat loss are not relevant.

0: Hey everyone, welcome back to be on the talk of podcast formed in conjunction with Ted xuf and independently organized Ted event determined to dive deeper into the talks that you know, and love I'm Erica and I Virginia back in Action second episode of the podcast is season. We are very very excited because today is our very first interview. We put it into perspective. We're going to talk about the be in business recent years. You probably have heard a lot about saving the bees and the dying bee population is seen a lot of increased press according to the be informed. Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.
1: Latest survey released this week beekeepers lost nearly 40% of their honey. Bee colonies last winter the greatest reported winter Hive lost since there since the partnership started it surveys 13 years ago. So that's really really insane that bees are dying and we still are like, oh these are dying. It's just a Min still no bees are actually dying and it's important so and given that policies are pollinators. We all know that and given that pollinators are responsible for one of every three bites of food. You eat according to the US agriculture department and most of these polymers are domesticated, honey.  Beats, so obviously we should care about them a little bit, right? Yeah, no definitely super important and you have actually plays a very big role in this because they are the world's leading entomology Department according to the Center for World university rankings. And in tandem with funding from the state just spilled a four million dollar honey. Bee lab dedicated to the next generation of be research. So after gonna be he's no that's that's the that's the be in business. So here today. We have our first interview Robert Schulte. Robert is a third year here at University of Florida.
2:  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.
3:  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.  So that is teaching so many other people about the life cycle of honey bees.
4:  Queen bee and worker bees and a few drones at the very at it was very interesting. Finally at the for station. We played a true or false begin test our knowledge about the life cycle of honey bees here are some things each of us learned. I learned that all worker bees are females. There are hundreds of kinds of the  these the drones are the only males in the hive if the if they're got to be too many bees in the hive a few drums and the queen find a new Hive and fly away and that and then under the queen will be born. We're glad that we know more about honeybees including why it's important to protect these important pollinators or also glad that pollinate minute.
5:  About this because nobody wants nobody wants to be reminded that something's at least in part their fault, you know, it is not true that the planet is dying. It is true that you are murdering the planet, right and the media would much rather tell you that the planet is dying number one, which does we've you feeling paralyzed. Yeah and guilty. Right, but nobody said you're guilty and then people can argue about whether individual a  Your matters or whether you have to have whole countries and you have to have whole countries. Well, then as China and India is not the u.s. Even though we polluted 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and the last hundred years or so anyway on and on and on you can do all that and it becomes more distant and you do become paralyzed and you do become depressed and people change the channel. Yeah. Yeah, so nobody wants to report the climate news, which is yes.
6:  Land managers and going for a pesticide recertification credits. I do a lot of extension with Growers on abilities to take their land and put it in a national or more natural habitats and solar companies and things like that. So I would say the bulk of it is working directly with beekeepers of All Sorts, but then there's a lot of it that's broader that's related to more just pollinator issues.  So I think that's great. You know, you've got very Target audiences, right? You've got Growers. You've got beekeepers Etc. So, how do you how do you fund your extension program? Right. That's one of the discussions in our world is we what we got all these great ideas to reach beekeepers Etc. But that costs money. So how do you generate funding to support your extension program at Michigan State? Yes million dollar question for all of us, right? We've been very fortunate. It is a time that people do really care about bees.
7:  What is it that you and your lab do at Michigan State University in the realm of extension? What is it to you? And what do you do? And what are you trying to achieve? Sure. So the main overarching mission is to respond to practical needs in the agricultural Community my rules a little different than some of the straight beekeeping extension and apiculture is positioned. So when I started I've been at Michigan State for 5 years now in my current position  And when I started I was hired to coordinate their overall pollinator program. So most of my research is honey. Bee diseases. That's my background is in disease transmission, but a lot of the Outreach I do is much broader than that. So it would include programs we developed a course to teach the public about pollinators. I do a lot of work working with pesticide recertification. And so I do a lot of extension to people who are
8:  Recognize the importance and so I would say that we do focus on programs that we can fund. Plus we do have some general funding. So my position itself is funded directly through Michigan State University my I'm funded half through egg by a research and half the MSU Extension. And so that does give me flexibility to kind of operate on things that I find important either way for our extension. We've received funding from both the Michigan commercial.  Purrs and the Michigan Beekeepers Association, we received a grant through MSU Extension to develop like our pollinator Champions Course, but now that has become self funded in that it does bring in money. So that's one of the things that we're trying to do a little more is findings programs that can at minimum be self-supporting so that they can fund the instructors and fund the space and from the bees or whatever we need. We did get a really large.
9:  Offit that does research for honeybees and different insects, but I'm definitely going to meet with the honey bee lab soon here at UF to not only talk about the research opportunity. I spoke about earlier, but how we can support them as a business because at the end of the day, we all have the same goal of making sure the bees are people understand how important they are not only to like having honey, but how important they are to global scale to the environment because without bees there would be many crops that would kind of get the hammer and not be as successful as they were. Yeah.  Familiar. Do you have like any advice for people that are trying to like, how can they help bees in their own little way and no because it's not that mean I don't think everyone is willing to start their own little be if anyone's like thinking about maybe getting B's I would definitely suggest it. It's not as big of a commitment as you think it is. It's super cool to be able to sit like to say you have your bees and any any doubt you may have there's definitely like a counter argument against it and I'm positive that
 
Topic 41 gmo food labeling: Some people say we should avoid foods with genetically-modified organisms as ingredients. I would like to learn about GMO food labeling. What are people saying about the pros and cons? What’s the difference between the European and US approaches to GMO food labeling?
[2978, 274, 2977, 275, 2971, 4430, 4424, 4429, 4423, 2763]
0:  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.  Hey, if you're liking this content, Please Subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos.
1:  Hold on people one second.  All right. So yeah organic is not special organic is, you know, just regular Foods actually, you know, if you do your research, you know organic food should be able to be made cheaper than actual GMO foods, but you know, they trick us with the industry and make us think that these things are not so so, you know, my point of researching all of this thing is that people don't know the depth of the problem. So therefore they don't know the death of the solution and a lot of us we
2:  Take vitamins and synthetic vitamins that are fortifying our food actually increase oxidation, but they're acting is oxidants anything that increases oxidation can increase inflammation and increase your risk of getting insulin resistance. So in summary, yes, it's true that the consume more bread, but they don't enrich it. It's higher quality. They don't snack as much they consume more fat. They consume less vegetable oils.  Less GMO foods and the quality food is much much better. And these are the main reasons why you don't have as much obesity if you want to compare to the US. Thanks for watching.
3:  All right. So yeah organic is not special organic is, you know, just regular Foods actually, you know, if you do your research, you know organic food should be able to be made cheaper than actual GMO foods, but you know, they trick us with the industry and make us think that these things are not so so, you know, my point of researching all of this thing is that people don't know the depth of the problem. So therefore they don't know the death of the solution and a lot of us we  I think that we leading our people in the right direction, but you end up killing your people. Yeah, I mean and that's why honorable Elijah Muhammad always said to joke too much joking is no good because yeah you go spread all this free publicity for Chick-fil-A and Popeyes em Tambo and at the same time what it all is done is creating more awareness. Yeah, I mean and in those areas these Popeyes and Chick-fil-A's or just going increase in sales yet those same people going to talk about black business all day, but you won't see them up there promoting black bear.
4:  of them are thin but I will say there's a big difference between the European countries and America. Okay, especially France and even Italy now the French consume a lot more fat the four times as much butter 60% more cheese a hundred eighty grams of fat from animal sources versus the US it's only 72. So in France, they're eating more saturated fats in America. We consume way more vegetable oil.  Like corn oil and soil which are GMO which can lead to insulin resistance. Okay, that alone can actually make you gain weight. They have three times as much pork. They have less high fructose corn syrup. I'll get to this in a second. They tend to keep their traditional foods. Okay, like in America, every single corner has a Thai restaurant in Italian restaurant a Mexican restaurant. You don't see that
5:  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.  There's no denying GMO when it's around it. Yeah, you know what it is.
6:  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.  I just kind of dismissed it because I knew it was a longer flour. So it didn't really work and my setup that I had and I finally took the leap to do it because we were trying to get into the solvent list and we know it's a tried and true as far as washing the flower but you know, I like it now. I'd like to get it back in the garden after growing it finally. How long did you end up running your GMO?
7:  Yeah, you know definitely it's going to affect it. I think just um you as a gardener is going to affect it what you spray what you feed it your environment. There's definitely a lot of variables when it comes to it. But you know as far as what I do I stick to a schedule I try to find genetics at work and that schedule so the GMO was a bit of an adjustment. Even our grape stomp or you know  It probably could have gone longer than what we did run it, but the flavor and the resin on it was just amazing. It's like my personal favorite next to the Mobi. Did you get that garlic out of that GMO that famous punch you in the face? Yes, it's got that GMO funk. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite one that I've had of his besides. The Moby is I really really stocked up on the GMO and it was available.
8:  Yeah, I mean there's definitely a lot of hype behind some strange nowadays but a lot of them stand up to it, you know anything with great flavor draws me and right away. I'm a big grape guy had Tangie for years.  Well, some of them stick right some of the hype is real like GMO you grow GMO and process GMO. I just did for the first time. Actually. I kind of put it off for years because you know, it got a lot of hype real quick everybody and their brother was growing it.
9: Welcome to the dr. Berg healthy Ketone intermittent fasting podcast. Now your host the man taking your health to a whole new level. Dr. Eric Berg.  So today I want to talk about the absolute worst three ingredients with so-called keto friendly Foods. Okay. First one is maltodextrine. So make sure guys when you buy food you read the labels do not consume food with multi dextrin. First of all, it's from corn and wheat mainly in the u.s. It's corn and Europe it sweet the both of these are GMO most the time like 95% of the time so you're getting residues of
 
Topic 42 fyre festival: Fyre Festival was a failed music festival which was planned to happen in 2017 on Bahamas. The festival was marketed through a number of social media channels, but the organisers did not deliver what they had promised the attendees in terms of accommodation and other infrastructure, and many of the billed artists never showed. The festival was the topic for several documentaries in 2019. I want to hear first person accounts of the festival, interviews with people associated with the festival, and about the legal repercussions.
[1072, 1612, 116, 229, 1071, 1613, 1361, 573, 28, 27]
0:  It was that it like ticked so many boxes in terms of like family Festival. So it was marketed as family festival and beforehand I was thinking is this thing is this just going to be like as it is that just like I mean look at the lineup is this as this is really going to be families. Yeah anyway, so it was loads of children running all over the place, which is actually quite nice. Yeah, the weather was excellent. It was really really diverse. I'd by far the most diverse Festival in terms of like age ethnicity bla black. So, you know, yeah that was  Great because like usually festivals are so middle. So like white middle class. I went to Glastonbury and for like the oldest Festival in the UK. It's like so like not on either arm is the ticket personal Brands and twenty hundred thirty quid that but that was like why appreciably chief that was right, but you're right at the end and yeah, so that was just like really really great. I would really highly recommend it to anyone who likes festivals. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's really feel like I've kind of play more
1:  Agencies in orders, right? So no longer. Do you have to have the middleman? I think Billy and the documentary says he had to pay somebody to talk to job rule then had to pay another guy to talk to John Woo. And so he said know what rather than going into this method. Let's just cut the middleman out and let's create something where I can talk directly to the artists have their schedule and say can I booked you on a Surface? Great idea. I think it's a great idea to promote the site. They decide to create a festival. Hence the  The title fire Festival which would which was supposed to be sort of like a Coachella but on a deserted island island that he said he had owned in the Bahama in the Bahamas, but it wouldn't they want they want to throw a music festival in the Bahamas. Yeah. So promote the app. Absolutely. That's what it that's what they want. That's what they want to do. Yeah, and they figured so they were smart about it. They said listen rather will get some marketing teams. But the biggest way to promote something now is through Instagram just like you said it would fashion over the
2:  DM me a tray of culture cast I usually reserve the official like Instagram account for anything related to the podcast. You guys can always reach out to me on my personal account a temuco POTUS if you want to as well, but okay with all that being said, let's get into this episode. So today we have on the festival finesse ER his name is Brian, but that is basically like his YouTube name. That's what he goes by the festival finesse. ER you guys can most likely find him roaming around a music festival hanging out on the  Mosh Pit front and center he wears these bright tie-dye shirts with his logo on them. He is a Jersey native to is awesome. So that's been really cool. We both have lived near each other which is really cool. We hung out at Ever After Festival. So he's in some of my Vlogs if you guys want to go check him out. And yeah and he's a content creator. He's got some really awesome Vlogs and music festival tips. That's his whole thing. He's really just trying to show people how they can finesse music festivals. And again, he's very into bass music.
3:  Friends and help get the word out about Reef Culture. Okay, I'm done talking about it. Now. I'm going to just give a quick intro into the topic for today's episode which actually was a suggestion from one of you guys. So thank you so much. I'm loving getting your input on what you guys actually want to hear me talk about so at Ashley underscore 21 send in a request for me to do a rave etiquette episode and since Festival season is happening. It's upon us right now. I thought I would just do this more about music.  Vowels and just etiquette in general for the EDM community. So we're going to be talking about a bunch of stuff today. I'm sure this is going to be a really relatable one because a lot of these if you go to a lot of music festivals you've for sure experience these and I know I have so I have more of like a list that I'm going to go down and we're just going to talk about what is acceptable behavior and unacceptable Behavior at Music Festival. But before we get into the episode, I am going to introduce a new segment to the podcast because as we do this,
4:  so when it's very light very much like like the new look kind of like jazz wave lots of live music from excellent live music but also with like the nighttime Shenanigans going on as well. Whereas Rosa it's at the same place to secret garden party. So you have it in. Yeah. It's a good good spot with Elation got bit of a got with a wood Vibe as well. Yeah weird vibe would survive and so despite the rain on the first night, like what made it so  It was that it like ticked so many boxes in terms of like family Festival. So it was marketed as family festival and beforehand I was thinking is this thing is this just going to be like as it is that just like I mean look at the lineup is this as this is really going to be families. Yeah anyway, so it was loads of children running all over the place, which is actually quite nice. Yeah, the weather was excellent. It was really really diverse. I'd by far the most diverse Festival in terms of like age ethnicity bla black. So, you know, yeah that was
5:  The title fire Festival which would which was supposed to be sort of like a Coachella but on a deserted island island that he said he had owned in the Bahama in the Bahamas, but it wouldn't they want they want to throw a music festival in the Bahamas. Yeah. So promote the app. Absolutely. That's what it that's what they want. That's what they want to do. Yeah, and they figured so they were smart about it. They said listen rather will get some marketing teams. But the biggest way to promote something now is through Instagram just like you said it would fashion over the  Way to do it. Let's go through influences. So they have 10 supermodels like top-of-the-line. Super model. Chanel Iman is one of them Bella Hadid was one of them and they said you know, what? Can you just put up this orange burnt Square as the logo for what we're about to do right and every day at this time. Can you put it up and they do it and it gains traction and hashtag it fire festival and then they do something really
6:  Made and marketed so spent a lot of time researching that and I'll post a lot about that in my newsletter. I think and on my patreon page as well. I actually don't have any travel until maybe South by Southwest will see I might be going there and I'm also probably going to be at this music festival / conference called tree fort Music Fest, which is in Boise. I've never been to Idaho at all. So this should be an interesting experience and I think it's like catered For towards  An artist as well cool. So yeah, very excited for that aside from that. It's the next year is like totally open. I find with a lot of this travel is difficult for me to like have a clear idea of where I'm going to be like more than five six months in advance, but I definitely want to travel a lot for my book just to interview people like I want to make it as International Global as possible. So I slept a little bit of planning around that like one which which artists will be going to stick with me and then
7:  My partner and my brother built from scratch. He's an engineer. So they started using that to live broadcast all of their music events. So they hire us to go in and install that and they use it for the three days at the festivals on from there. Once we got into that world. I was shooting a lot of my own personal films at the time. I was shot one in Hawaii and the island of Kauai and I showed it to one of the guys on the production team at Red Bull TV. Well,  we were at one of the festival's just doing broadcast and they really liked it. So I kind of kept on them and kept sending them some of the passion projects that I was working on for Film Production in the hope that I could shoot some of the recap videos for their music festivals and lucky enough about two years ago. They finally had an opportunity at one of their big festivals and they got us to produce there after movie, which is basically like a recap of the entire Festival so
8:  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.  Blogs on my YouTube channel, which will be going out the end of this week and over the weekend. I got so much footage you guys I really went in this year. So it was also my first media pass which is super exciting literally was one of my main goals and I can't it feels surreal that that happened like when I started all this I was like, oh my God if I could create content and just travel to music festivals and do that like as a job, that would be my goal. So to actually do that this past weekend and be able to come back and have all this in
9:  If that I want to share with you guys, so now we can get into the episode which I'm super super pumped about. So this past weekend, I actually had the opportunity to attend my first bass music festival and my first music festival in Canada. So two and one which is incredible and so there were a lot of first and I really hope to do a lot of Festival reviews here on this podcast. I wanted to dedicate an episode fully to talking about this experience what it was like so that you guys are a little bit more informed if you want to check this Festival out next year, you know a little bit  More about it and you sort of get my opinion on it and my thoughts and that Festival is Ever After Music Festival. It takes place in Kitchener Ontario. It was about like I want to say 45 50 minutes outside of Toronto. That's where I flew into but I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about how I found out about this Festival why I wanted to go and then yeah and then we're going to get into the whole thing. I'm going to describe what went down my thoughts on it Pros cons and give you guys my just honest opinion on everything. I also am doing daily vlogs.
 
Topic 43 hong kong protests: Since early 2019, more or less continuous protests have taken place in Hong Kong, to mark popular displeasure with various aspects of power shifting from the local governing council to the Chinese central government. Students from the many Hong Kong universities have been at the forefront of the protests. I want to know more about who is protesting along with the students and what the popular sentiment in the general Hong Kong population is.
[576, 575, 78, 574, 13, 79, 85, 77, 16, 17]
0:  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.  With cheap drums up just avoid the protest.
1:  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.  For a four star hotel in Hong Kong and I did check the airbnb's for Hong Kong and it did seem like it was cheaper. So those of you who you know in my ER my traveling around the world style how I don't live anywhere. I just go from place to place Airbnb to another and you want to try it out and it kind of an exotic Place go to Hong Kong now don't know.
2:  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that
3:  he actually talks about Hong Kong here. And I'm gonna as it he was in he was in Hong Kong as I write from my four-star hotel and calm in Hong Kong which cost me a mere $25 per day I cannot but think about how erroneously risk is priced into the market when I arrived high at Hong Kong airport was eerily quiet with tourist avoiding it unbeknownst to them. However Hong Kong continues to be one of the safest place place.  On the planet. So I said this before in a previous video that I think now would be a great time to go to Hong Kong that I bet it's pretty cheap to go to Hong Kong right now. So what he's saying is that people are scared to go to Hong Kong. Thus the market is saying we're not coming here and the prices are dropping on the hotel's there's no one's going there but yet it's safe. So they're incorrect. So yeah their protest going on, but if you're not in the protest if you're just there in business, he just said he's paying $25 a night.
4:  So but how would John so how would China starting riots make them appealing to Hong Kong intern doesn't just show that they can't control them.  The Chinese government had one the protesters to not play with fire not to underestimate the firm resolve the central government and not to mistake restraint for weakness. China could also be making the association that the Hong Kong government alone can't deal with such manic. So it is required for China to step in by the tenth week of protests. The airports are shut down due to protests on the 11th of August and the foot on the 4th of September Carrie Lam announced that she would withdraw the extradition brought together, but protesters said it was too little too late.
5:  Addicting to watch because as Beijing has been or as Hong Kong and Beijing have been bred been closing in on their their grip of the Hong Kong people and the protest the protests have been getting bigger and we're out of control in some ways and one of the bigger developments over the last week or so was the the Hong Kong police. We're trying to storm a university that  Hong Kong Polytechnic University and when they tried to storm it there was a fierce resistance. So people inside the university were they ended up barricading themselves into the school and to the university and fighting back with like petroleum bombs and arrows and Molotov cocktails. It was extremely interesting to watch and these people are fighting for
6:  Outsource our manufacturing and other jobs all over the place. Our immigration system is just fucked. So to me I'm like look, I wish we could do something with Hong Kong, but I don't see what we can do and then on a principle from a principled stand point. I don't know if there's anything we should do except stand in solidarity, but beyond that I it's not our fight if that makes sense. So anyway, what's going on currently is?  The students that were in the Hong Kong University, I guess they were running out of food and resources. So they all decided to flee and a bunch of people from the city are helping them get out. A lot of them are helping. So if you're not watching what's going on in Hong Kong, you should it's so it's just fascinating and we are seeing in real time how people are fighting for their freedoms because they know and I've said this already like this situation only had a couple ways to go either they get
7:  So as people may or may not have been paying attention the situation in Hong Kong has not stopped. So I talked about this months back. I mean probably four or five months ago talking about the situation in Hong Kong how I legitimately did not see a Way Forward except confrontation or there's really only two ways the situation is going to resolve itself. Either Beijing is  To give in to the demands of of the Hong Kong protesters and allow Hong Kong to be self in Lao Hong Kong to self-rule or there's just going to be massive protests and there's for who knows how long into the future until there is a bigger bigger wider conflict. So sure enough the developments over the last few weeks have been incredibly.
8:  By this point here is what the protesters still want one the withdrawal of the right description used about the 12th of June protests to an amnesty for all arrested protesters 3 and independent inquiry into alleged police brutality for universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong's chief executive and legislative Council and five the resignation of Carrie Lam.  I'm confused. China has one of the largest military forces. So why haven't they just taken Hong Kong by force? Well while this would spark a massive backlash in the International Community the actual main reason China have kept pushing to completely take control over Hong Kong is due to the fact that this would destroy their proposition to unify Taiwan under there one country two systems rule the opposite of already unfolded in Hong Kong have led to popularity leaning towards the governing party in Taiwan who favor continued Defiance of Beijing China.

Topic 44 thanksgiving comedy special: I remember hearing on the radio a comedy special recorded for Thanksgiving by Jack Benny.  Can I find it as a podcast?
[1411, 640, 3, 931, 669, 1678, 4, 2306, 3047, 2940]
0:  This is a pack a day podcast. Welcome back to another episode of the packet a podcast.

It is great to be back and it will be a very special episode as you say because we were going to be breaking down the Packers special teams. So why don't you give us a general overview of the team's if I can call it that from last season? Yeah. Absolutely. I'm actually this week Rick Gosselin published the 2018 special teams rankings and according to Goslin Packers fans were right in their
1: Not sure for this episode coming, right? It was supposed to be a Thanksgiving special but we were measuring now, please enjoy our fish action of bending in that's good Hunter now, don't you all stand away when the little girl has come on a town.  To all know which name Bambi come on attack. Oh Boris. Do you want to go hunting for Thanksgiving? Yeah, we need to go hit and so we can eat a turkey. But okay, I can give it a try. I've never tried it before so I can give it a try look good baby, which view could you want to take? You want to take your Lamborghini?
2:  Giving I understand that Christmas is more Universal International. I say this is a Jewish person nevertheless. Let's extend the holiday music season and not get sick of Mariah Carey and sync by Thanksgiving by introducing a whole new catalog of tunes November 1st. Let's hit press play on the Thanksgiving anthem by Kelly Clarkson Kelly. I'm putting you on notice these write a song If this take is a car lot.  Not I just walked by one and I did a double take ice above. What's what's going on over here. Now your walk by to look at the sticker price, but I need you to come running out of the office and say can I interest you in this take today? So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a vision or better yet a sound for this you need to convince Thanksgiving music take a test drive right now. Okay. I think we can agree. The Thanksgiving TV special is also underrated. However those which we do have our fantastic Monica with the turkey on top.
3:  That is started because doubly got a started. Yeah, and the thing was we we had about 500 people there and we'll probably move in more than I remember the Mike Lemoine saying we had close to 700 people which was crazy. And this is our first show together and I was like, wow is this how it usually is it's not it's definitely not and so we did the show it went well and like at the end of the show. I'm like riding high and like this. Is it my high school career. This is the best thing in the world and  Then I got arrested in front of everyone that was there. All the students leaving the school. These two big cops came out to me has everyone was walking out of the auditorium and they were like, hey, are you Chris? I was like, yeah, then I'm thinking they're gonna like congratulate me and they like, oh you're under arrest and they Jack me up against the wall and we're going through and they're like, we're your parents and I'm like, oh, I don't know. I think they're home. I don't know what's happening and I'm like shaking. Yeah, and I remember hearing one
4:  get a fucking job over here, you know bada-bing bada-boom, like people say, oh thank God so today on Rio radio as part of this little special because I know that I said, it would be a question and answer but I forgot that was on this Monday's episode the one that you'll hear tomorrow, which will have been four days ago because this goes on  Thursday of next week and we were recording this on Sunday of a week where we've already recorded the episode for the following Monday. Yes, but that is the first episode where I started advertising this so nobody who if anyone sends in questions things. Will they shan't not but here's the good news, but but that's good because that means or at least hopefully close enough for someone to understand.
5:  Honestly, love you guys. Okay, would you like some extra special news? Yes as a little celebration for completing four weeks of amazing radio shows the BBC are coming in on Thursday. No, you're kidding me. No kidding BBC Radio Bristol are coming here. And you're going to be part of the BBC Radio Bristol show children versus the news and if you're lucky,  We have time we can maybe get the gentleman who is coming in from BBC Radio to join us on BLC radio. He's kidding. Oh my God, he's not - he's gonna be remember always wear shorts.
6:  Not I just walked by one and I did a double take ice above. What's what's going on over here. Now your walk by to look at the sticker price, but I need you to come running out of the office and say can I interest you in this take today? So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a vision or better yet a sound for this you need to convince Thanksgiving music take a test drive right now. Okay. I think we can agree. The Thanksgiving TV special is also underrated. However those which we do have our fantastic Monica with the turkey on top.  Right on front that's an iconic that lives forever. What if we could have gone back in time and been like hey Rembrandt's thanks for this one great song, please write a second to kick off the Thanksgiving season somewhere a Rembrandt is like we have a double-disc album stuff. No one ever. Listen that was gonna be one of my question. Are we sure there? Isn't that scary isn't Thanksgiving music out there. I'm gonna do while we're talking. I'm gonna look on Spotify. I'm pretty sure that even if there is good things happening music. Why did the public Consciousness and there's no
7:  To talk about that. I'm going to introduce a new guest. I'm Jack hit I'm a magazine writer. Mostly occasionally do some radio podcasting and you know, sometimes a book Jack has had a long long career. He's won multiple Awards and he has made and heard hundreds and hundreds of pitches in his long career. I was Jack's producer at This American Life meaning that he often pitched me.  Meester ideas and we would do them together. I brought him in to talk about one pitch in particular a pitch that started out with lots and lots of problems. But that eventually became the basis for a very very special story. So as I remember, my friend Agnes Wilcox was the director of the prison arts project in Missouri, and she had actually called me up and said look, I'm I'm I'm directing, you know men sentenced to life in a maximum security.
8:  It's 73 and this is an interview with Kelly Starrett and she is an Adaptive music educator and works specifically with special needs students and teaching them music. So if you're not familiar with adaptive music education, this episode will give you so much information about it and how you can work with special needs students in your music classrooms. This episode is all about strategies for working with special needs students in the  Graham especially deaf and hard-of-hearing and Technology adaptations. You can make with your students. So a little bit more about Kelly before we dive into this episode. She has been an Adaptive music educator for almost a decade and she works specifically with students who have special needs as well as deaf and hard of hearing individuals with disabilities. Kelly is a speaker blogger and author of creative Miracles at practitioners guide.
9:  That is the best thing I really did and I would say I would say that video for this is America the Childish Gambino. Like that's dark dark dark comedy, but like that hit it like there are certain things that are kind of grazing it. Well, who's the woman who had the stand-up special on Netflix Oh Nanette Hannah Hannah Gatsby. I would say is someone who like so there are certain people that are scratching it that are like, oh this feels like it's now because that's what comedy has to be. It has to  Now and has to play around with the expectations of now and I just think the big problem is what the hell is now because we produced that movie the house. That's not a masterpiece, but I thought it was like a solid funny comedy was Amy Poehler it was Will Ferrell. There's a bunch of moments in it that I laughed at the director. I thought it looked really good. I mean my God that movie tanked. I couldn't believe it. I was like I know way claim. It's an all-time great comedy, but I was surprised like it really tanks.
 
Topic 45 drafting tight ends: I heard a podcast about strategies for drafting tight ends in football.  I’d like to find it again.
[1001, 2023, 998, 1002, 2024, 1132, 999, 1160, 2022, 1668]
0:  10 times last year pretty ridiculous what you know speaking of tight ends Tom before we get into our rankings. We really should break down the some of the news that's come out today. Apparently the Giants are sending an MRI of Evan engram foot to dr. Robert Anderson. Who's one of the foremost foot specialists in the country. We have no update on that right now, but it does appear that the Giants are concerned about Evan engrams foot injury. Which would I mean look, he's a top  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.
1:  And to play tight end and that obviously worked out tremendously as he was Pro Football Focus is number one graded Tenon and all of college football last year from receiving standpoint. And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.
2:  AC Hayward on the outside so you know expectations should be a little bit lower for those guys. I think this is a spot where Darren Waller has to bounce back here. It's been kind of quiet here to catch games the last and the last two games for them so that you know, that's not going to cut it. I mean the tight end position has been very brutal here, but you know, he's got it that needs to bounce back and I know the numbers say this matchup isn't good, you know tight ends are averaging just like three-and-a-half catches against the Chargers this year.  But they've only faced the top tight ends they faced so far this year Jimmy Graham and Darren fell so, you know, sometimes the tight end numbers especially can be a little bit deceiving because you know, there's just not a lot of great Titan options in the league. So this should be a good tight end game though. I mean, we've probably touch on the the Chargers passing game here a little bit. It's shaping up pretty well hit a fairly Rivers is you know, he's his numbers of bounce back here. He's just had you know poorly
3:  Fantasy option and like you were saying this is actually it's actually a kind of deep tight end class on the waiver wire right now with some guys who are who are constantly emerging. Yeah potentially emerging. So go listen to our our waiver wire podcast about the tight ends and read Tom's waiver wire article up on fantasy free agents.com. But Evan engram going down would be a huge huge loss at the tight end position. Yeah, it would be time to you know, if you've been rolling with just one tight end that's happening.  Might wanna wanna might want to stash somebody here this week Mike a sickie is you know, kind of emerging here a little bit no offense, but that doesn't really do any good this week because they're owned by but you know, maybe Jared Cook was dropped, you know, he's gonna finally get the see some extended play with Drew Brees here only really played five quarters with them to start the season here. So the other there's some guys out there even Jacob Hollister. We talked him up a little bit on the waiver wire podcast Russell Wilson has thrown 32% of his touchdown passes to
4:  You've seen guys like George kid'll Dalton Schultz and on the list kind of frankly goes on and on you can get the wide tight end later. And so if they do feel like I'm are Sadie's Lois or Jimmy Graham aren't part of the long term, you know desires of the front office, then you can either pick up, you know, a why tight end in free agency for relatively cheap. You see a number of of them go cheap as you know, frankly. Did Jared Cook a few years.  Ago or marcedes Lewis before last season, you can get the blocking tight and or take them in brown for five or six take, you know, take the blocking tight end in wrote in round four or five or six next year. So I'm not concerned about the way Sternberg a looks. I agree with it. I think a year in an NFL strength and conditioning program is going to be a huge deal for him. But I think he's as advertised as well. I have a little bit of concern about him just in the sense that I thought he
5:  And make sure to follow me. So you never miss an episode.  Welcome into the atom Brenneman show life in the red zone. I'm Adam brennaman, and I appreciate you guys tuning in today. Got a really cool episode for you. Please make sure to rate subscribe share this podcast all of your support has allowed this thing to keep growing. I truly appreciate it. My guest this week is one of my best friends mikasuki the former Penn State tight end All-American current, Miami Dolphins tight end who just had the game of his career last.
6:  But they've only faced the top tight ends they faced so far this year Jimmy Graham and Darren fell so, you know, sometimes the tight end numbers especially can be a little bit deceiving because you know, there's just not a lot of great Titan options in the league. So this should be a good tight end game though. I mean, we've probably touch on the the Chargers passing game here a little bit. It's shaping up pretty well hit a fairly Rivers is you know, he's his numbers of bounce back here. He's just had you know poorly  Luck in the touchdown apartment just average of 1.3 touchdown of the game. But the Raiders are giving up the most in the League 2 .8 a game here. So this could be a spot where Phil rivers and you know, this is Mike Williams is plugged pretty freaking. Well right now, he's just had really bad touchdown luck. I might go out and say, you know his touchdown regression comes to an end here. It is could be a spot where he gets his first touchdown this year after
7:  You know, I listen to I listen to you and hacks episode like parts of it heard my name called a couple times there and then actually got tanks from some of my buddies. Listen to the podcast saying do Davies Roshan you his podcast so, you know, there's been a little bit of tension between me and the podcast but I am happy to be on I had Pat fried Marathon. I don't know if you heard this one, but Pat was telling me that he's been  Watching tape of the great tight ends at Penn State, and he first of all he goes Pat goes, you know, I've been while I used to watch your tapes and that to me and I'm like Pat you didn't watch my tape, dude. No don't lie and then never happened. Then he goes. I've been watching my cassock he's tame and I said, I hope you're only watching the the pass catcher. I hope you're not watching them, but I want to start talking.
8:  I I saw a couple people say he looked decent and in drills, but can you expound on that a little bit Ross? What did you see from from Stern Burger? I didn't see a ton from Jace. I think one of the the day that you're speaking. I'm Randy got excited was you know that day I was gone which was Saturday in the padded practice. It is noticeable though. I mean Jake is wide receiver convert, I believe and I think he played like wide receiver at KU. That didn't work out transfer to Texas A&M  And to play tight end and that obviously worked out tremendously as he was Pro Football Focus is number one graded Tenon and all of college football last year from receiving standpoint. And I think that's going to kind of continue to be the deal is that he's the move tight end. He's the the flex guy and you know, he might be closer to Evan engram than we ever even imagined as far as whether or not he's one-dimensional. But if he makes plays consistently it's not going to
9:  About a guy his size is his three-cone. He went out and ran a seven point five nine three cone, which is an above average time for a tight end his size. So you think about that short area quickness. That's something that I think he can do. Well when you look at what he does best coming out of Toledo, he was billed as a guy that could be that in line tight end that could potentially, you know, split out every once in a while, but really what you want Michael Roberts to be doing is blocking he  Is a guy that just is a massive human being had a very good run blocking score from Pro Football Focus coming out of college looking at his Pro Football Focus run blocking grade. Basically the his first two years in the league, it's above average but he doesn't have just doesn't have a ton of reps doesn't have a ton of experience kind of got buried on that depth chart in Detroit. So your biggest concerns with him are just really his athleticism is not
 
Topic 46 missouri quilt mom: I listened to a podcast about a stay-at-home mom in Missouri who opened a quilt company and I would like to hear it again.
[972, 971, 859, 979, 977, 973, 1212, 980, 858, 970]
0:  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to
1:  Okay, and so then my Five-Year Plan is so I spent seven years living a dream. Basically. Yeah, it was a dream seven years living that dream and then I quit abruptly to be a stay-at-home mom. And so the thing for me is like I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't quit my job to have  Ambitions and plans and things that I wanted to do career-wise. I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. And so when you asked me about my Five-Year Plan, my Five-Year Plan right now is to take care of my children right now. Now I'm realizing in this season of stay-at-home motherhood that I need more than just to be a stay-at-home mom. I'm realizing that
2:  I do know that I want this to be a place where I can you know, just kind of download if that's the word and I don't know if you can hear my daughter in the background, but occasionally, you'll probably hear a child or two or three or four in the background because I am a stay-at-home mom. A lot of the things that I do. I mean when I'm recording this podcast, I'll be recording it at home. And yeah like right now  Door is opening. So let's see who that is it Sprout. Hi Aniyah.
3:  I feel like  Being a sing. I'm a stay-at-home. Mom is like Typecast like it's not just that you know what I'm saying? Because you know you do a lot more.
4:  First of all, you're not just a stay-at-home mom. You're very much a lot more than that.  You know, I mean like I think you have tons of ideas and talents and things that you can do.
5:  Like I love my kids but I do need something else that is going to help like three life into this might sound so bad to somebody who really loves being a stay-at-home mom. You can judge me all you want to but or stay-at-home parent doesn't necessarily have to be a mom. But I just there has to be something else too. I feel like and I need to  Time to figure that out. I was listening to the love our podcast and they had some guests on there and they were talking about how like in this when Melissa was going through her similar transition as far as like her career path to becoming an entrepreneur in doing out things. She has this thing where she's like space and Grace like give me the space in the grace to be able to figure things out. But her guest on the podcast was like not only space and Grace but
6:  About that like those listeners and what they're interested in and really get a more intimate understanding of what it is. You're oddly who your audience really is and I mean just thinking about the Micro Niche listener. I mean I listened to a podcast about cereal it's breakfast cereal ribosome that most famous. I don't know. If you've ever heard of this podcast serial, we're going to talk about no, I listened to a podcast about breakfast cereal. It's positioned as a relaxation and kind of an ant  anxiety depressant to kind of calm you down and whatnot. But think about the person who's listening to that. They are super interested in what this host has to hear. So anything that you attach yourself to that fits that bill that might have this really small microculture. They're totally leaned into it and they're going to take that host. We're not necessarily as gospel, but they're going to Value it and when they when the host finally comes around and says, hey, well, we're coming at that time a season where we're going to put out listener survey.
7:  Being a sing. I'm a stay-at-home. Mom is like Typecast like it's not just that you know what I'm saying? Because you know you do a lot more.  Yeah, space and Grace, I guess I totally understand that.
8:  Men, like men are totally welcome to come and listen to this podcast, but I do my intention is mostly to encourage women and if men can find encouragement and listening to this podcast, maybe they gained some kind of insight about what their wife might be thinking or maybe it's a conversation starter for you to have with your wife or vice versa. So be it like I'm not trying to discriminate as far as this podcast is concerned.  I do know that I want this to be a place where I can you know, just kind of download if that's the word and I don't know if you can hear my daughter in the background, but occasionally, you'll probably hear a child or two or three or four in the background because I am a stay-at-home mom. A lot of the things that I do. I mean when I'm recording this podcast, I'll be recording it at home. And yeah like right now
9:  I got love for me going. I don't know it's gone. I like you all the time even right now you're doing cheeks and she'll get you know, I love those Jeeps, you know, how like stay focused? Okay, but your cheeks are those cheeks that people would want to pinch. I like to pinch your cheeks there. So,  Okay, and so then my Five-Year Plan is so I spent seven years living a dream. Basically. Yeah, it was a dream seven years living that dream and then I quit abruptly to be a stay-at-home mom. And so the thing for me is like I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't quit my job to have

1:  List of bye. Bye. Bye, you know, that's it's just such a turn-off. It is a turn-off. One of the things I do is I ask people to take a picture of themselves with my book and I'll create collages and I'll just Express enthusiasm. I love seeing people's beautiful faces with my book so you can you can share those types of things. You're not overtly selling the book but people will read the title and the like that sounds interesting and so I  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people

3:  because I have enough privacy. It's like a to be read pile, right? Yeah where I'm like, okay, I think that this could Inspire because it's about this bubble up and at the end I was like, so if you have any recommendations for books about young women trying to find themselves in the world like 20 year olds or a book that gets a little weird. Please recommend it and multiple people recommended sourdough and they were like, it's by the same author who wrote mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore and I  Like that's so crazy because mr. Penumbra's was such a big book and I never heard anything about sourdough. Like I never heard anyone mention true. Yeah, so I looked it up and I was like, yeah, this actually does sound kind of cute. Maybe I don't know I'll kill it was like now in the back of my mind and now last week raelene had visited here and we went to a book shop together and I saw this book just randomly on it on a sales table for seven dollars and fifty cents and I was like, okay. Yeah.
4:  We talked about this in the interview, which I thought was super fascinating to the people who have written a book have more Authority or that are legit. And literally that doesn't mean that at all, you know, there are people who literally just get book contracts and put out books in their shit. We talked about the still Harmony nice. I haven't read her book yet, but I'm sure that if I read it that I would like it right because I'm sure it's going to be real if you make her bad. It doesn't make her wrong. It doesn't make her any less ice.  I see what you mean, whatever but because she's written a book as a book now. She's more exact. She's are we nice author? Exactly. No and and how you're not somebody in this community unless you've produced a deck or you have written a book and how that somehow solidifies your place in this see that but I also like 100% I like I see exactly what you're saying. But also our community has an amazing job of recognizing small Talent like
5:  I always tell other authors because I talked to a lot of authors. I wrote a series on on LinkedIn. It's on my it's an article on my LinkedIn profile called. So you want to write a book and it's a 9 video series and I talked a little bit about this stuff on there. But I love helping authors promote themselves because I've learned so much from you map on how to do that. So another thing that you can do in addition to sharing reviews and pictures of people give away copies to people  People who have podcasts people who write blogs people who post regularly and just write them and say, you know, I thought you might be interested in a free copy of my book.

6:  That collab and I read each other's effort. And I know they can write but once that collaboration happened is like is not how I thought it was going to be. Yeah, I do. I'm not I'm not big on collaboration. Yeah, I've seen it happen before I've read a collab where it was like obvious who wrote would any kind of like right and see I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah. It was like now one one book. I did want to leave. I did like by two ought to do was trust no bitch. Bye.  Cash and Nene you really didn't know which author wrote was because both all the characters was like some some Thug as motherfucker. So, you know people will do my sneaky and conniving so it's like you really did not know who wrote it and that's why I really like that Series. Yeah, that makes sense. I
7:  A 2012 event Nat Geo Adventurer of the year. He is a author of 13 books. He's a motivational speaker, you know adventure of the grand sort of like, you know cycling around the world for four years as well as just micro Adventures that he's talked about in his blogs and his books and now his podcast and so this interview with allister's is all about the different channels of sharing his story how he kind of has approached each what's going  on on across the you know, the bookie just launched the podcast and just as general perspective on life and how to fuse Adventure into it. It was really great chat. Yeah. I can't even believe it like it. Was it spoke to me on such a deep level. So I know it's going to resonate with you all as well. So, please enjoy our interview with Alistair Humphreys Alistair. So good to have you on the Stoke cast. How you doing?
8:  Today, so as you know generation I believe removed to me that was scathing was literally what I say about every single book I come in contact with and okay guys. So that's most of the time not their fault. It's normally like the Publishers that are like Precious. I know that now but when I wrote this back in 2015, I didn't know about Publishers. I thought that people wrote a book and sent it out, you know, and so I was like, why would she write this? You know, I was sad I can't believe it and so guys  I um, I'm at home without I'm at home by myself. Okay? I see a notification come up that I've gotten a friend request on Facebook none. Other than the author of this.
9:  The book club and you share your thoughts, right? And you know that at least some authors are seeing probably like some chatter on every this is what I found and this is not meant to be conceded. This is like literal fact almost every single one of the authors that we have covered like with if it's a book. I know that they are aware of the of it being done. Yeah of the book because they saw a spike in sales what the fuck's going on probably or I've reached out to them or  You know like for whatever reason yeah for there's like there's there's a lot of reasons for sure. Do you feel like that makes you I don't think that you're the type to feel censored but would you think twice if you knew that the person that wrote a book was watching Always. Hmm, and that's not really fair for the ones that I don't think are watching. But at the same time, I think it's a good reminder for me that these are people people these are Creations. These are babies that they made so while I think
 
Topic 48 spike lee movie score: Spike Lee movies have well curated scores.  I heard a podcast interview where he talked about one of his movies and the process of curating the score.  What was it?

0:  We need mentions for he's like, hey, you guys want to come to see a screening of Chiraq? What and we were like, yeah. Yeah, of course. Yes, and so we got into a town car with Spike Lee and his driver and we thought were going to like a proper Premier. So yeah, but it was a screening room where they were still like doing the final editing touches on the movie we should and it was a screening room kind of like a if you had a nice home theater, like it was a room like that me and Kevin sat down to these like these baller chairs.  All made from like unicorn hair and a and reindeer and reindeer quills or something and we sat there and watched Chiraq that sounds like a Spike Lee fantasy sequence from like it - like when we when we make the movie about the podcast we're mean Kevin play ourselves and is directed by Spike Lee. Yes. It does not please himself. Yeah the walk to the Spike Lee screening. It will be on the that that standard Spike Dolly shot where we're floating over the ground.

Yes. It does not please himself. Yeah the walk to the Spike Lee screening. It will be on the that that standard Spike Dolly shot where we're floating over the ground.  I had to leave in this like to on our into it an hour and a half into it because I had to go be on CNN. I was on my phone during the screening trying to get out of it because I was doing all these text messages and emails trying to get out of it and they said no and I was like, I was like a half second way from texting. Well, then screw all y'all I quit the entire thing. Like I don't need to quit his job. That's segment know the CNN show working for CNN. That's Show Business.
2:  percent off federal and state filing  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.
3:  So we're going to start the the clip portion of the show and we will start with a clip from your show. This one is actually from the Spike Lee episode. I really really really enjoyed the hell out of this clip. It's from conversation about spikes 1998 movie He Got Game, that's about a high school basketball Prodigy named Jesus Shuttlesworth and his relationship with his long incarcerated father who's played by Tada Denzel Washington spike is telling you and Kevin a behind-the-scenes.  Story of a pivotal scene where Jesus who's played by Future NBA Hall of Famer Ray. Allen is supposed to be his father in one-on-one game. It starts with you asking Spike a question about the movie swell, and there's a fizzle famous story and I feel like we want we've heard it from other people but here from the from you the one-on-one game. Yes. All right.
4:  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.  In mounts and he walks in by himself. No Handler. No extra person. He doesn't say too much and it wasn't till he sat down and we actually started recording and he goes what's up young brothers and we all laugh but I realize oh, he's here to have a good time. Like he and he that's what he let us know. He'd listen to the podcast more than one episode and he reference ever there episode. I mean, I understand this and I think Henderson the only reason this podcast can exist is because of the four movies that Spike did with Denzel. Yeah.
5:  and then do it. Yeah, there's eldest go another battery both of moral victory for themselves. I'm feeling keeps going for baskets on the NBA great in my hall of fame future Hall of Famer. I feel like you can see when he scored the first basket like real go. Wait. What the hell? Yeah. You just sitting Courtside again. Another God. What a great game the thing. I really really like about this clip is it shows how much people like love Denzel?  Part of it spiked really seemed like he was like a really cool guy. It's funny because when we when I told people who knows but like people in the industry, like who know Spike and have dealt with Spike. I was like, oh, yeah. We're we interviewed Spike and they're like, oh which Spike Lee did you get because there's there's there's fun Spike. There's also like fuck you motherfucker Spike which which I think he gets a lot of time with a lot of people get I've seen it. Yeah, he showed up two hours late. He leaves no is going to be late, but we were sitting there for two hours. That's Suddenly It's like the ten.
6:  Because I again I think it's now in the tied with Winter Soldier as my favor MCU movie in the series of 22 movies. It's it's an amazing movie people if you haven't seen it yet go see it if you've seen it once go see it twice if you seen it twice go see it three times. If you've seen it three times go see it four times. It is an amazing movie so high  Highly highly highly recommend it. I mean it's its comic book come to life. It is a perfect comic book movie it there's nothing much more than I could say about it. Other than that. The only other thing I will add to that is the music that's played during the movie The Score Alan Silvestri did the score and it's amazing. I've listened to the entire score if you haven't
7:  Like spy like Denzel square is great without those four movies Malcolm X Mo Better Blues He Got Game. Those are regularly in people's top five Denzel Washington movies. It's all like to me it kind of felt like when Marc Maron interviewed Obama and then he looked like he had like that. He had like the entire like decompression session where he was like, okay. So Barack Obama was just inside my garage talking to me like no big deal. What was the rest of the day like, well, it's funny. That's funny you say that because we weren't able to decompress right away because after it was over,  We need mentions for he's like, hey, you guys want to come to see a screening of Chiraq? What and we were like, yeah. Yeah, of course. Yes, and so we got into a town car with Spike Lee and his driver and we thought were going to like a proper Premier. So yeah, but it was a screening room where they were still like doing the final editing touches on the movie we should and it was a screening room kind of like a if you had a nice home theater, like it was a room like that me and Kevin sat down to these like these baller chairs.
8:  Highly highly highly recommend it. I mean it's its comic book come to life. It is a perfect comic book movie it there's nothing much more than I could say about it. Other than that. The only other thing I will add to that is the music that's played during the movie The Score Alan Silvestri did the score and it's amazing. I've listened to the entire score if you haven't  To and its entirety highly recommend it overall that main Avengers theme it's kind of a pretty generic piece of music. I mean, it's not like iconic at least it never really was iconic but it is now I think kind of like Batman 89 or John Williams Superman theme or those are really iconic pieces of music, but I think this Avengers fanfares Avengers theme has now become very very iconic it stands out.
9:  I really liked it. Yeah. Yeah, so I guess the only thing left to do is to like conclude this phase. Yeah done with Phase 1 phase one phase two. What is the first movie of phase 2 the first movie of phase 2 is Iron Man 3. Oh cool. So that should be fun. I think that is an underappreciated Marvel movie. It's not one that is talked about but let's just kind of go down the list of movies that we've watched so far and give our scores so and Iron Man, oh and you could  In scores now if you want it. Yeah, we can change scores. I gave Iron Man and 8 out of 10. Hmm. I also did get given an 8 out of 10 and our guest garcy gave it a 7 out of 10. Okay. Incredible Hulk was the second movie. I gave it a 3 Keenan gave it a to and Garcia three. I feel like that that definitely stays that was the stinker of the yeah, the whole thing's rough. Yeah, then Iron Man 2 what you gave an eight I gave a 7. Hmm

4:  Focus and so we had a little tiff about it but long story short we went to the car place. It was a terrible experience. So on the way back he was like if you still want to stop at the thrift store, let's do that and I hadn't thrifted since we went to the beach, which I don't know if I told you guys about that I probably should tell you about that too. I digress.  And it was lit, I got so much good stuff. So I was glad we had worked out our little squabble though because every song that was playing in the thrift store was like one of the saddest country songs. I may have ever heard every single one. It was kind of hilarious. So I'm listening to sad country songs and sorting through the most amazing Thrift some of the finds that I wanted to tell you guys about was I got for Vintage House dresses.
5:  Alms and I just felt like I didn't belong there. So yeah, it's just very interesting. We got out and we were we got a public housing. So we got a house and I thought all my problems would go away, you know once we got a house and it was a nice place frankly, but I just more followed man, my mom had to work and she got her van repoed. And I mean this the list goes on and on but it's kind of  How I can look back and start to connect all the dots in my life thrift stores. We shopped at thrift stores all the way up until shoot. I think my last year in high school or even to this day. I mean all my stuff is from thrift stores and some people don't realize you know, the good gems you can find you guys do so.
6:  How I can look back and start to connect all the dots in my life thrift stores. We shopped at thrift stores all the way up until shoot. I think my last year in high school or even to this day. I mean all my stuff is from thrift stores and some people don't realize you know, the good gems you can find you guys do so.  But yeah, I mean that's I found Sports. I kind of put all my anger and frustrations into that and just kind of made it man went to college and I played football and I ended up tearing my shoulder my senior year in high school got surgery and then when I went to college I tore it again. So I was like, you know what it's time to hang it up and I think in general man, you gotta you gotta find
7:  The toys and I found this like $30 toy that was like two dollars and was like, I couldn't believe that I got this toy when that happened fire was just lit inside me of like I can't believe that this is real like that. This can happen. That's the best origin story ever. And your dad is my hero. He's my hero too. He's the best. That's the best way to tell somebody about a thrift store ever. That's what I tell my kids to and we go  yard selling and I'm just like babes. This is a treasure hunt and my daughter will take over the thrift store stylist eventually, but I it's I mean, you know, it's it needs to be taught. It's real. It's a real deal. I know I like that so your kid has go with you and yeah, they know they're on your Instagram. I see them in your stories. They're adorable. Thank you so much. Tell the lasers a little bit about the thrift store stylist. How did that all get started?
8:  Being jeans and a t-shirt every day because that's kind of what people wear in the country. And so I just I didn't know what else to do. And so I just dressed like everyone and when I got to college, I have very minimal sewing skills. And I found that I could reinvent myself and I could just go to Goodwill and local thrift stores and I could buy things and I could change them and make them my own and I could be the person I wanted to be a despite what anybody else was wearing and  Masks and so I really found a home in that and the more I did it the more clothes I had and so in order to keep up with my love of clothes I had to Thrift because I was to the point where I was literally turning the extra room in my apartment into a closet and I didn't have money so I had to be cheap, but I also loved the unique things that I could find and then I came out here to Arizona and ended up moving in next to one of my favorite thrift stores. And so
9:  Lee and I can't wait to meet you IRL. Yeah and reach out to us where can people find you so they can continue this conversation with you over the interwebs. Yes. So it's at thrifts Thrift underscore store underscore stylist on Instagram and then on YouTube, which is new. I only have three episodes so it's fine or three videos. It is thrift store stylist.

3: Hi everyone. Welcome to quicker. My name is Billy of a muscle and I'm your host the idea of this podcast came about because of my Instagram stories. I started to share some very personal details about things that I went through as a someone queer person. A lot of the feedback or the engagement that I was having was from people that I didn't even expect to be engaging in the conversation that I was having. So that was really interesting and I just from that point. I've wanted to expand upon just having Instagram stories, but I just didn't know how I was going to do that and that was either through a podcast or YouTube channel. So here we are.
4:  Time so I went in I was always interested in going in the military, but I was never motivated enough to go right lose the weight because it's hard. Yeah get in.

And while I was what I was in there I got held back in what they called the like the maps is  kind of like orientation you go in for your shots and stuff, right? Okay. Also give you like eye exam medical exam and all that and I was blind in my but well not blind but I could definitely not see very well out of my right eye going into the military, but I was really like devoted wanting to go in. Yeah. And so what I did was I cheated I cheated just to get to basic training. So because I knew you know, you cover up your left eye and you're right on you that I couldn't see out of my right arm.
5:  Just sort of talking about how witchcraft has has been clear. Heather had been queer witches. It's pretty it's pretty short. It's a short sweet little article. I'm trying to find it has a really good quote about a quote for some queer witches. They may find that they're witchcraft helps them to shape their identities as queer individuals in quote. Just talking about sort of the connection between between basically your queerness.  So then your witchcraft your practice helping you sort of shape each other. I think specifically in this case. They're talking about based on the quote. I just gave you there. They're specifically talked about witchcraft helping you shape your eye your personal identity, which is fair. I feel like it can go both ways. I feel like you can use your identity and also shape your craft. I say as a person who still hasn't really explored it as deeply as they should but I like I like the the notes and it sort of leads into the next article I have
6: You are listening to the women of the military podcast where we share the stories of female service members and have a military touch their lives. I'm your host military veteran military spouse and Mom Amanda Huffman. My goal is to find the heart of the story and uncover issues women face while serving in the military. If you want to be encouraged by the stories of military women and be inspired to change the world keep tuned for this latest episode of women of them.  military
7:  I'm being on the firing range in the shooting range for hours on end. You know, this thing's do impact you after a while but you know, every veteran in experiences something to where it's going to impact them in the long haul and the and the more resources that the government is putting towards the study of Veteran well-being while they're in the military and getting a Baseline and really focusing in on the long-term effects of military career.  No, it's good that the although we're behind the curve as a country on it. The people are still there starting to now get some unique benefits. I mean the sure even though there's a lot of work to be done at the VA. But the VA is yeah open their eyes more. It's got it's gotten a lot better and I can say from personal experience and I've told you guys so if you caught it been out for 1 year and 1 I'm like a I'm a planner. I don't leave anything to chance if I can and even before I got out of the Navy I had all my VA paperwork submit it.
8: Hello, this is AJ Roberts 15-year British forces veteran entrepreneur high performance coach and loving father and husband this podcast is for the motivated and inspired for those looking to level up their lives for Fitness Nutrition and their mindset. Welcome to the best version of you.  Hello boys and girls and welcome to another episode of the best version of you. I met Jay Roberts and today. I'm very very proud to bring you an amazing guest another military veteran of the Great British forces. Mr. Steve. He knew Steve. How you doing? I'm great energy. Great good to speak to you. Awesome, man. Well, thanks again for coming on the show. We've is something we've been trying to get together for some time and it's brilliant if we manage to kind of get
9:  So so, you know, I got involved with some organizations that do help veterans. Some of the bigger ones like the American Legion the VFW Veterans of Foreign Wars Fair the DAV and you know, a lot of a lot of those eight, you know, you walk in and as soon as you walk in the room you in a room full of people that experience a lot of the stuff that you did. Yeah, you know and is really cool too because some of them they do have some older members like older veterans, you know.  But it's kind of like humbling to know like whatever it is that I went through. It's nothing compared to the you know World War Two veteran and I'm sitting next to it. Yeah. We're that Vietnam veteran that I'm sitting next to. Yeah, because you know, they're 40 50 years older than me or whatever the case might be and it's like, you know, they went through this when they were younger than I am now, right? They're still here, you know, so, you know how selfish would it be? I say selfish, but you know what?
 
Topic 52 fauci interview: An article about COVID-19 referenced an interview with Dr. Fauci that took place when the virus had not yet reached the US.  I would like to listen to it.
[1202, 2965, 2983, 745, 2973, 137, 2982, 1201, 266, 863]
0:  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview  View and the problem I have with all those interviews where they got these actual guys that like kind of like except Article 13. It's always like 10 minutes and they got two minutes to speak themselves and to respond. Maybe they got one minute. So if they ever are in a corner where they have to like say, oh my God, I'm actually deciding this because of this and that there was getting cut off. So what would be really interesting would be like a discussion where it like has no end like where they can really trapped and him so they would
1:  Hamilton, but yeah, I didn't I think the first time I like actually listen to my own music was probably in like 7th or 8th grade when I was just obsessed with the Phantom of the Opera because I watched the movie and then I watched the show at like Manheim Township or something and I was like, I love it so much and then I just like listen to the soundtrack. Like usually you don't like I  Listen to other people's music. I don't have like a style of my own you like get it. Do you like understand them through that or you just think it's interesting? I mean
2:  They dig my parents. Don't just like listen to music. My mom will listen to like Bob Marley like Cat Stevens or something, but my dad never listens to music the only time I ever listen to music as a kid was like when we were driving somewhere and we'd have 90.3 on yeah the time but other than that like we just never listen to music, but that's weird too because you get a lot of reading and that's nice words into because I spent ninety.  percent of my childhood just reading right so then I would be like you'd be likely to also get that with lyrics maybe because I definitely didn't used to pay as much attention to lyrics like two or one year ago or whatever just
3:  So I always so I also do off camera interviews like just for my job. So there's like  like sometimes you interview people to do like the research for an article, but sometimes you're interviewing them for the builds. Yes. Okay. Um, so I would say favorite hmm favorite on camera interview.
4:  No, I just like don't which is why I can listen to normal music while doing homework. Hmm. Like I can just listen to anything. I'm not like I can't have words because I'm not less. Yeah. Anyway, they're just there. Yeah, they'll distract me. I definitely can't do that. I definitely used to be like that. But sometimes you just gotta put a song on repeat just a little more. Okay. I'm not with the Spotify not not make a playlist. Just one song. I've done that before. Um, even though I could just  beat it. You took the effort it because one of it on their 70s because when I would be like hey Google play my name of song playlist because you couldn't tell it to repeat the song because it would do it once and then move on to the next song. So it was like out of necessity, you know, no necessity is the mother of invention. It's true and then there's some songs that it's like, oh I listened to this two thousand times because I listened to it on repeat as I read the Harry Potter 0
5:  That they're sort of not buying the fact that it how did you know it was upstairs if you've never been upstairs and now you're still talking about not going upstairs, even though it clearly you clearly have bit upstairs, you know, it is a just digging his own hot. You're right and we've found this a lot with clients that are used to be in listen to clients that are used to people not interrupting them or questioning them and obviously prince Andrew is a prime example of that. The truth is a journalist is looking for an answer and whether it's a print interview a radio interview or in this case a TV interview.  You've got control of your answer. So you answer the question the way you want to answer and then you stop and this is not what happens with so many people in power is there used to be in listen to and they go on and on and on especially someone like Andrew who feels is got a point to prove and if I keep talking these guys are going to love me eventually because everyone loves me and that's the attitude he heard he just couldn't stop talking and we took we took as well about legal speak corporate speak. Yeah this sort of you know, this I was
6:  It was four days straight. What up to the gate? I mean to be fair. It's a good start. I don't remember Googling. What's the most on time songs ever listen to the song because I was like Howard but then it was like me way more than that. Yeah, that's just a person who's listened to the same song on repeat for like 12 years. And then the ask would probably gonna end up my question is yeah is the reason I don't listen to music because my family doesn't listen to music my family.  They dig my parents. Don't just like listen to music. My mom will listen to like Bob Marley like Cat Stevens or something, but my dad never listens to music the only time I ever listen to music as a kid was like when we were driving somewhere and we'd have 90.3 on yeah the time but other than that like we just never listen to music, but that's weird too because you get a lot of reading and that's nice words into because I spent ninety.
7:  Exactly. Nothing else behind what's the point? There's got to be a pond behind it because like there is going to be the EU elections. You know, I think it's gonna be I think it's something like China like, you know saying there's like a bigger master plan behind it. Yes, not shyness like to control all the platforms to make sure you know propaganda make sure nothing wrong gets to the people and I feel it's something more in that direction than than like. Oh, we don't want because why would the EU K? Why would that you politicians care about copyrights?  Much that they don't listen to the people who tell them not to do it. You know, I mean, it's something else behind it, which I don't really understand you think those the hearings on in the EU Parliament. You think they like upload it to YouTube or something like the German government hearings always uploaded to YouTube probably. Yeah like to listen to like what their what their arguments are as to why it should be implemented into National like they don't even know what they're talking about. That's the problem. Yeah. It seems like it does like every interview
8:  My posture the business where people well that's not really what WF G is really because it's what my wfg is I still do it you watch me now and I'm with people I don't bake them into W of Jim to what do you do? Why would I do? Why would you work with me? Hmm? What would you what would you be interested in about it instead of I always ask people that when they come in for an interview, even their one-on-one. I'll be like listen before we get started. Tell me about yourself.  Right. I don't really need to know about them but it just told them I'm assessing you. Okay, now I'll tell you about us all reciprocate. So we use your fault interview from your system. And one of the questions is, you know, one of the questions you ask is. Why would you do this business if we let U, yeah, if we let U, yeah, exactly. Yeah, so you get it. I'm telling you stuff. You already know no shit. Alright guys. So after listening to that audio, I hope you caught how intentional.
9:  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's
 
Topic 53 recommended books for entrepreneurs: I was told about a podcast that recommended good books for entrepreneurs.  I’m trying to find that episode.
[551, 552, 1614, 411, 63, 412, 3629, 2125, 62, 2124]
0:  I years ago read the called the read aloud handbook by Jim to release. Oh, yes. I read that one. She wasn't yeah. Yeah, and then where she's just throwing it out there where one of our favorite books that both of us have recently read is called the read aloud family by Sarah Mackenzie. So she was inspired by Jim. Yeah. It's an incredible book that we both really recommend and we'll give you a lot of insight into  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so
1:  the importance of read aloud's and also some great books recommended within their as I was reading it. I was taking notes and adding things to my Amazon cart just so I wouldn't forget all the books she mentioned but it's a really good one. So we're going to kind of break this second this sick. What am I trying to say episode up into segments? Thank you. So kind of some of the benefits of reading aloud how to have success with reading aloud. And then we're going to do some of our favorite read aloud books. We've done. Yeah, so you are in for like a triple treat. Yes. Yes. Okay, so  We're going to talk about why do we even need to read aloud and some benefits from it? Yeah reading aloud is a great and easy way to help your children reach their full potential. What does that mean? I will so as I was Googling it that's like on therapists and education websites like it was everywhere. Yeah, like this is a huge Foundation the principle of a way to help your child to reach their full potential. It seems so simple right? It's kind of weird that something
2:  Went we were grappling with and what we might have needed. I think that reading picture books can be an incredibly cathartic thing to I just recommended one to a student of mine who described an experience that she had had as a child and it reminded me so much of this book and I have no idea if she has kids or not, but I was like you need to read this book like get this book for yourself. You could be young at heart, you know. Yeah, I never cared for a good picture book on that note we do something.  Which you're familiar with since you listen to some episodes called feeds and reads where I get to pick your brain and get recommendations for myself about what to read and who to follow and stuff. Yes. So to start out. Is there anything what's the best thing you've seen on social media today or this week or the last time you were on social media? Yeah, so I have been actually trying to not be on social media. It quite as much I found that it's like just so much better for myself to not be on it, but
3:  With it. But again, what do you got to lose but eating healthy but one day I was at the chiropractor and I heard this woman who had been in the hospital for four like on and off for weeks and she was pretty young probably in her forties maybe early 50s and she was explaining how sick she'd been to this the receptionist and I couldn't help but hear it. I was 2 feet away. So when I was done I said hey if you have you tried, you know celery  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and
4:  Do you get experience if you don't have experience normally it's having great experiences having making bad decisions. And so you need to do first bad decisions that you will have great experience. But another thing you can do is, you know, you can read books. You can read books about other entrepreneurs. You can listen to your podcast and listen and I think this is something that helps.  Listen and read a lot of podcasts and entrepreneur books and then you start with a single project and you try to to to start with an MVP and start directly with marketing and talk to people and if you see that people have something in their eyes and they're like, oh, this is a cool thing then you're on to something. But if you need to explain if you need to
5:  A juice Anthony Williams really recommend that if you have any digestive issues at all and again to me that's a quick thing when he got to lose if you know doing celery juice and every day well anyway, she didn't even know me. I kind of told her that and told her to read this book and she researched me down who was that recommended it and they called me and she said I've got to send you thank you card and just literally said that she was on the pathway to healing and it was all because that I took time to tell a stranger about a book and and  She's now on the path because of Anthony Williams and she's on the path of healing where Western medicine and nothing's really been able to help her and release nutrition. So anyway, it's exciting me and I've been I mean, I've read it probably three times and over the last two three years. But anyway, that's what I'm kind of working on and I think it's a great read. I love I love medical medium those of you who interact with me on Instagram. I do celery juice every morning and I've noticed a huge difference in my digestion.
6:  All right. I have this special talent of stocking and finding information about people online. That is honestly I've gotta give it a it's a gift. I told the girl at work. I was like look I have found this is I'm kind of telling a Side Story now, but actually this is kind of a cool story. I'm not sure if I told it on the podcast before I had a friend years ago who was kind of a friend of a boyfriend or  whatever, but he never knew who his dad was and all he had was like a first and last name and his kind of generic or whatever and he did that's all I knew and one day he was like, oh, I've always wanted to like find my dad, but I don't really know how to look and I was like look if you want me to find your dad. I will find him you have to be sure that you're ready or that you actually want to because I'm not going to do all this work and find him and then like you be upset that I actually found them. So just be clear and be honest if you
7:  It necessary recommended or completely optional if someone was new to this work to start at the first book. I think it's not going to hurt anybody. That's for sure. I think it'll be helpful but the guides say and they've said it from the beginning that they teach in a one-room schoolhouse house and you know, they meet their students wherever they are, you know, so they're always teaching to the collective. I was told recently that  you know beyond the known realization would be published in Russian and it's the only one of the books that I know of that's going to be published there and I thought well that will be interesting for that readership because they're not going to have the context I tend to tell people when they ask to go where their lead, you know, some people are drawn to one book most of them if the teachings resonate with them and go backwards and you know read up and then go forward to what's next and I think these books, you know, it should be said
8:  But on the same time be your your hardest critic about it the this is it and this isn't something you could I think you can't boil it down to numbers or maybe somebody tries it but I've never seen it because if somebody figures that out, you know, that's the essence of Entrepreneurship. When do you decide to stop a project? And when you decide to proceed with the project one thing is experience and how  Do you get experience if you don't have experience normally it's having great experiences having making bad decisions. And so you need to do first bad decisions that you will have great experience. But another thing you can do is, you know, you can read books. You can read books about other entrepreneurs. You can listen to your podcast and listen and I think this is something that helps.
9:  All these aspects of the self that are really tethered or tied or waited to fear or in agreement to the denial of the Divine. It's a little like being turned inside out and my experience and that's where they've left us and I don't know what the next book is there teaching some new stuff in the last month or two and workshops that I assume will be the basis for where they go next, but I'm not going to say that for sure because I truly don't know. I don't know the title of the next book is it?  It necessary recommended or completely optional if someone was new to this work to start at the first book. I think it's not going to hurt anybody. That's for sure. I think it'll be helpful but the guides say and they've said it from the beginning that they teach in a one-room schoolhouse house and you know, they meet their students wherever they are, you know, so they're always teaching to the collective. I was told recently that
 
Topic 54 bias in college admissions: I read an article that mentioned a podcast about bias in college admissions.  I would like to listen to it but I don’t know the name of the show.
[1098, 753, 1097, 1099, 829, 977, 579, 978, 929, 2214]
0:  been alleged to have paid college-prep Man William Rick Singer who according to CNN has been paid up to 25 million dollars total by different parents. Not just these two ridiculous people, but other people too, okay to ensure that their kids look their best to gain College admissions to prestigious schools. Now, I know I have a lot of listeners in different countries. So I want to say this. I know no matter where you are money talks. And so it might not seem like a big deal to get let into a school because your parents pay  More or can pay more but let's talk about this scheme specific. Now the way that these parents were going about making their kids look better is paying people to actually sit for their college admissions exams things like the SATs, which is something that we take here in order for students to be able to be let in to colleges you have to score at a certain level for certain schools. So they had people sitting up there taking the test for them and according to the story. These were higher scores than these kids could have probably ever dreamed of ever.
1:  Huge differences from each other and it's really helped me understand privilege and bias and it's really just blowing my mind and it's written amazing. So it's so good such an interesting story and it is fictional, but I think it has very real it feels real when you read it. It's really good.  Okay love but we have a combination of fiction and historical and like current things but there is that thread that about judgment and and bias and objectifying other people and pushing a wow. Well, that's crazy. We did not talk about that before that's pretty fun. But they're important thing. Yes. That's all you Morgan part of Being Human. Yes. Alright. We are going to take a break and we'll come back with our self-help recommendations.
2:  Arrogantly carried out my goodness. It's just felt it's ridiculous. So let me bring you all up to speed. If you do not know about this Scandal. So to make an incredibly long and seemingly lying reported story short what we saying is that the children of wealthy parents more specifically stars like Lori Loughlin. Y'all know who she is auntie Becky from Full House. Uh-huh. I am feeling I'm Becky right now and Felicity Huffman from Desperate Housewives. They  been alleged to have paid college-prep Man William Rick Singer who according to CNN has been paid up to 25 million dollars total by different parents. Not just these two ridiculous people, but other people too, okay to ensure that their kids look their best to gain College admissions to prestigious schools. Now, I know I have a lot of listeners in different countries. So I want to say this. I know no matter where you are money talks. And so it might not seem like a big deal to get let into a school because your parents pay
3:  More or can pay more but let's talk about this scheme specific. Now the way that these parents were going about making their kids look better is paying people to actually sit for their college admissions exams things like the SATs, which is something that we take here in order for students to be able to be let in to colleges you have to score at a certain level for certain schools. So they had people sitting up there taking the test for them and according to the story. These were higher scores than these kids could have probably ever dreamed of ever.  Corn the tomfoolery did not stop there. They also had some of these kids admitted into some of these high-level schools and wonderful prestigious schools as athletes when they had never even played some of these Sports they were photoshopping their faces on the pictures of them playing things like water polo and of the sports that some of these kids ain't never even been in the pool as if those crimes and lies were not enough reports also say to top it off some of the parents were applying some of these fake
4:  And then tabula and outbrain make money because those sites like Life Buzz and articles Valley are paying them to put links to their site on like the website you're reading CNN or whatever. Yeah, and then the confusing thing is that those sites like life buzzing articles Valley. They also can make money from tubulin outbreak because they also agree to have Chum boxes on their own sites. Okay. So like if I read an article that little Chum box, it's an advertisement for a bad news article on another website.  And I'm supposed to go that other website so they can serve me with advertisements for other bad news articles on other websites. But like at some point for any of this to work one of those articles has to have like an adverb product on it. Eventually what happens is so in addition to ads that are just ads for like clickbait articles Brands will put stuff in the chum box as well. So occasion will be like like I tried this electric toothbrush on the internet and had amazing results. Yeah, come on boy.
5:  Yeah, I mean it does take time and I don't think that there's anything wrong with not having you know, a set solid plan in place when you take that leap of faith. I mean that was everyone's first question. What are you gonna do? What's your plan? I don't know what I'm having for dinner. Right? Like if you asked anyone even students in college. What is your plan? I want a whole ass Vision. I want to point blank. What are you doing? They don't know what's the difference between me not being college and not knowing nowhere.  Nelly no one knows and I feel like I didn't know like I think I know more now that I'm not at school then when I was in school, like I didn't know fucking anything like I will go to my advisor for the dumbest stuff. She's like, I don't know and I'm like you're supposed to know you're my advisor but like I didn't have all the answers in college. I just had to like kind of just take that leap of faith and like figure it out on my own whether people supported me or not. Now he's kind of like listen.
6:  Tails and again, I kind of already described what they did previously so I won't dive into much but again if these mapping stuff is confusing you or your you want to learn it to Great articles. I think you'll really have a grasp on these things after you read them next up. We have an article by suroosh conlou about continuous integration and kind of made me laugh when I read the beginning of it says a few months ago Aaron Patterson tweeted about some three-year-old uncommitted code said that feeling when you work on a patch for three years and it's like 2K lines of code, then you commit it and you hope can  in use integration passes CI passes was like wait a minute three years for a commit like holy shit. So basically, you know, naturally it didn't pass and then you know, he says at this point Martin Fowler chimed in, you know point out that if a patch has been developed for three years is most certainly not continuous integration and that's kind of the main idea of this post by suroosh a lot of people think of CI continuous integration as the tools like he says here, you know, it's like a build server, you know something bit rise buddy bills Travis Etc, you know,
7:  Nelly no one knows and I feel like I didn't know like I think I know more now that I'm not at school then when I was in school, like I didn't know fucking anything like I will go to my advisor for the dumbest stuff. She's like, I don't know and I'm like you're supposed to know you're my advisor but like I didn't have all the answers in college. I just had to like kind of just take that leap of faith and like figure it out on my own whether people supported me or not. Now he's kind of like listen.  Have to live in a fucking tent in my parents backyard or some shit or in the forest. Like I guess I'll just do it. Like if that makes me happy I was gonna do it like whatever but another thing about like out growing things and also just the whole dropping out of college what it showed me is that like sometimes your friends aren't your friends that is the T and that's that's the T for today. Like there's even something that bold.
8:  Awesome. Yeah, and we will link the article within the show notes as well. So check check out the show notes. Click on them read the article. It's fantastic and might be the beginning of a new start for you. And if you'd like me to come talk to talk about it or to get a hold of me, and I've been presenting on it quite a bit over the last year. So yeah, let's send you ever everywhere everywhere they want so let's send you there. There you go. Awesome. Well, thanks for chatting Eric, and we will talk to you later. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you.  you
9:  Go out and like party and have fun, but it took a lot for me to kind of come to terms and path and so because of that I am very not where I want to be in terms of like my college like career.

2:  In a way we can describe it as gaslighting with positive intentions. They learn to question their own reality and in turn to mistrust themselves, it erodes their self-esteem. I know that's kind of hard to hear just sit with that for a second. We've most likely all done it in one way or another.  Many adults have learned to do this from their own experiences with this as children when their parents.

6:  These are examples of being congruent you are.  Acknowledging that the other person has picked up on something and instead of denying their reality.

Topic 58 sam bush interview: A bluegrass magazine I read mentioned a podcast interview with Sam Bush.  I’d like to hear it.
[965, 147, 146, 964, 1858, 135, 5, 9, 10, 204]
0:  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.  Really does sound like you both. It was really the sort of like almost instant creative coming together and weird ways I happen to be for is that like was that unusual? So it's I mean, I'm done one moving of them one television show outside of this. So my experience is limited, but the fact that she and I hit it off so quickly so early is practically unheard of I mean, the first thing we do is like oh, yeah, we all know each other's names.
1:  So if you like what you hear you can subscribe for as little as 99 cents a month. You can subscribe to the podcast and support the show it is what it is. You know again, I think it'd be neat. I think it would be neat to produce something give the world valuable content and break even at least break even for your services. I think that Sam Harris following that model so he has a subscription and I'll be honest I  I work in a conservative religious University and I subscribe to the same hairs podcast and I do that because I believe that what he is putting out is is good content for the world and I want to support that so, you know, we'll see if people want to support the Jake she'll show if not, no worries, but I do think it would be neat to
2:  that's not the gold is not full times. It's just on the side, but I think it would be neat to say hey, you know the Blog podcast is self-sustaining in the sense that I put out the content and through you know ad revenue or subscribers or whatever. It might be. It is a self-sustaining Enterprise. I think that'd be neat. So we're going to do a mix of advertisements and listener-supported opportunities.  So if you like what you hear you can subscribe for as little as 99 cents a month. You can subscribe to the podcast and support the show it is what it is. You know again, I think it'd be neat.

3:  It's Series on Amazon homecoming starring Julia Roberts, which was nominated for three Golden Globe awards. Although it didn't win any of them. Now people familiar with me or gimlet the company. I co-founded which makes this podcast that you're listening to right now and many others you might remember homecoming began its life as a gimlet podcast and gimlet was very involved in the making of that show. In fact, I did a whole series of Stories on turning the homecoming podcast into the homecoming TV show.  And the reason I am very excited to talk to Sam espinel today on without fail. It goes back to an interview. I did for that series. I was interviewing Sam along with the star Julia Roberts and there was a moment from that conversation that just stuck with me. It's a moment when Julia was raving about Sam. I mean, I think Sam is incredibly good at understanding people and how we work and what makes people as highly creative as they can be and and is highly motivated as they can be to hear you both talk.
4:  Like having technical knowledge is equally important but I think that you know, being energetic spontaneous hopeful having good communication skills and being in some extracurricular activities to show that you're flexible enough in order to do anything in your life is important as well. So I would just like to remind the listeners of this podcast that interviews are not just a game of how much do you know, it's also a game of how how well can you present yourself? So personality is a  Rate factor I can say so exactly what is the number one piece of advice that you would like to give people about cracking the interviews? Okay, so I have failed like quite a few interviews, but then whatever I've learned from interviews, I would like to share it. So first of all, listen to the pre placement of very carefully because that will help, you know more about the company. So before every interview or online test the company comes and gives you a talk. So you have to listen to it very carefully because that's
5:  three hours might be two and a half hours. It might be an hour. But rarely, will you hear Sam Harris or Joe Rogan? Say Okay hours up our time limit sup, I mean, they just let it go until it organically dies. And I think that's the way that that a podcast is meant to be. So no time limit again. I'm not a fan of that.  Also in this is one that's that's I don't want to say controversial but you know different people have different viewpoints. We are not going to edit the podcast we will not edit. So if we're live with a QA or we have an interview, we're just going to keep going to examples there so Sam Harris he edits his podcast and and he, you know allows his guests to go back and redact and we'll wait a second, you know, let me edit that out and so on and so forth.

7:  In 1960 the 14 year old Bush was sent away to attend the exclusive all-boys boarding school Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts here. He lived in the shadow of his more successful aluminous father for a fun-loving Texan Phillips. It was a drastic change. The curriculum was rigorous the environment was Ultra structured and it was cold push. It was pretty envious of his buddies back home.
