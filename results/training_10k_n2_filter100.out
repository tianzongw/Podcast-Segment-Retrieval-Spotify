Topic 1 coronavirus spread: What were people saying about the spread of the novel coronavirus NCOV-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019?
0: It started.  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.
1:  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.
2:  Is past whatever the flu kills, you know hundreds of thousands each year. I think they're really important thing to understand about that is that those hundreds of thousands? I mean you have the flu does kill them however the flu as far as we know based on current evidence and whatnot is less contagious or at least I should say has a lower are not number meaning. It's it's not spread as easily.  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%
3:  Alice's of the situation as well as the I guess impact on the economy because of course that's where my mind often times goes. So quick recap. This is a novel virus.  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.
4:  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%  And furthermore we've known for a while that the flu even on some of its Worst Years. And of course, I'm excluding certain outbreaks of the flu. There's been like Hong Kong flu many decades ago. There was a Spanish flu or whatever. You want to call it French full American flew back in 1918, excluding those obviously the flu largely targets elderly populations young young populations and immune compromised which based on
5:  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.  In China and thus far it it, you know, it produces.
6:  but get into today's topic, you know, I almost hesitate to throw it another podcast about this this Wuhan this Chinese coronavirus and yet I mean I on this Friday  How can I do anything about that because it really is what is driving the markets today. It's driving a lot of these headlines me. If you turn on the Nightly News, if you turn on most mainstream news programs during the day, if you go over to 0 head, you know, most of the news cycle both financial and non-financial really is is fixated on this this coronavirus. So quick recap on where we're at right now, officially.
7:  Said the world is dying. I think the market got the coronavirus. I think that's what happened. Do you mean - let's talk about your theory of the coronavirus. That was pretty interesting. Yeah, so I have a friend that doctor that I was talking to her texting today and he was saying that and walking and can attest to this but every single person that we talked to in Walkins Discord already had a bad flu this year myself. Yeah, including walking like I literally every one of us like multiple days where we were like in bed and you know for a lot  Of people it was viral. I got one that was bacterial and one that was viral this year already. He was saying that common cold that you got probably wasn't this virus specifically, but the common cold is a coronavirus. That's how it's our started what he was saying is that, you know, a lot of the people in the developed world that got that really bad cold already and went to the doctor and everything probably have a higher immunity than people who haven't gotten it yet. Even if it's spread here roof and you know, like every single person got it a lot of people would
8:  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.  And it's a relative of SARS the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was was a big deal back in the early 2000s. Also close relative of Words, which is similar to SARS. But Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome and very similar symptoms and whatnot. And the same is true for Coronavirus. Now that the mortality rate the deadliness of this new coronavirus. It's still up in the air. And again, we'll be talking more about those numbers a little bit later on today's episode.
9:  Hon, but also some surrounding cities in the cash. I don't remember the name of the province hoobae. He hey some big cities right will haunt itself is roughly 11 million individuals. And this has spread to a ton of other countries around the world including Japan South Korea Thailand Australia. I think there's a potential reported case and France Russia the UK.  I believe and of course the United States we have soon to be three potentially three confirmed cases of this coronavirus here in the United States mostly from people that recently traveled to China usually the Wuhan providence province. And of course, this is a coming up on the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is is a big event for people traveling and whatnot. So certainly not a good time for this virus to be on the move.
 
Topic 2 greta thunberg cross atlantic: What were people saying about Greta Thunberg’s sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the fall of 2019 and its relationship to global climate change?
0:  Ooh were fighting climate change is there it exists we have all of the tools in front of us. It's just a matter of acting like this. That's a great idea but like make it so that every new building that's built is NetZero. Like that would be amazing. Another thing that done. I don't know. It's a strange still giant, you know that and subdivision. I'll tell you why it isn't done and this relates to some of the questions you sent me. What what we can do is in relates back to Extinction rebellion, and Greta is  People have to speak up and not just to friends and family and stuff like that. They have to speak out and speak up and show up. Just imagine next Friday right have the second part of the global climate strike on this. Yes on the 27th of Millennium Park 12 to 3, but matching of thousands of people showed up for that rather than I mean probably a few hundred will come and hoping in the Thousand. Yeah, let's get a thousand but I'm saying imagine if that
1:  Tidwell considered himself a historian first and to salvage your second he couldn't pass up on the opportunity to discover something new. However, he did not have the financial backing to salvage. What was inside the eye 52 descending to 12,000 feet below the surface of the ocean isn't your average cruise for starters the human body cannot survive those depths without the protection of a submarine or other kind of pressurized submersible vehicle. Even the most skilled scoob.  A divers can only reach depths of a thousand feet a salvage operation on this scale need a deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear making multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean that sort of operation would take weeks and cost millions of dollars. And that's when Jim Philip own comes into the story.
2:  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.  Because with warm water in the atmosphere is damper, that's all drawn up so that you not only get greater wind speeds. But lot more water is poured down on communities when it comes down and it would have been the past. I'm not sure where the original question was here. But I don't know either keep going. Well Greta to finger good. She's saying that that we need to panic about it because the situation is that bad and even if say we were wrong
3:  A divers can only reach depths of a thousand feet a salvage operation on this scale need a deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear making multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean that sort of operation would take weeks and cost millions of dollars. And that's when Jim Philip own comes into the story.  Jim Phillip own was a wealthy lawyer from Rochester New York Tidwell promised Philip own a cut of the treasure and was able to convince him to invest two million dollars in the mission Philip own also spoke to National Geographic stating quote my motivation for doing it was first and foremost for the excitement and history but profit was by no means a small part of this if Paul is right. There's 20 million dollars worth of gold in the ocean and I
4:  Miles of islands like it's two days sailing away. It's some of the deep, you know, some of the deepest ocean the Atlantic and there you are. There's human beings crash. That's how you'd also see big troll marks from panting. No.  He's back.
5:  Those right? It's like a regular thing now well water levels are rising around the world because of climate change has occurred just till now and the the speed of it is also a very concerning because I think scientists were saying we wouldn't see a ice-free Arctic North Pole for another 20 or 30 years. I think it's if I have I may be wrong about that but not for 10 or 15 years at least and some  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.
6:  that an image finally appeared on their sonar the unmistakable shape of a submarine finding the legendary Japanese submarine i52 was the easy part salvaging a 2500 ton vessel from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean was an entirely different story theories varied as to what was actually inside the ship from material to build an atomic bomb to a peace proposal meant for the Allies, but  How would explorers reached this treasure what was truly inside the Japanese? I 52 submarine was there really 20 million dollars worth of gold 12,000 feet at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. And if not, where could it have gone?
7:  Disaster on a massive scale even more frightening is the possibility of misuse of biotechnology in creating dangerous and resilient diseases pests and weeds. This could be done deliberately as a means of bioterrorism or accidentally by some overzealous. Idiot in a lab coat if disaster movies have taught us anything number three Gulf Stream shut down. The Gulf Stream is a huge global current which carries warm water Northwest across the Atlantic Ocean warming Western and Northern Europe. However, global  Warming is causing problems for this by Heating and melting ice caps into the Gulf Stream Global Warming. Ironically slows it down and there is evidence that if the trend continues it could eventually totally stop as well as making Europe even colder and greater than it already is this could result in disasters ranging from huge climate changes including massive storms to a mass phytoplankton Extinction. You may recognize phytoplankton as the things which everything else eats did I mention that Europe was cold enough already number two.
8:  So they were cutting class to go and stand in front of city hall or the capital and they're still doing it and that's what Greta started a year ago. And now she's up for a Nobel Peace Prize on mainstream news. It's hard to find Greta. Yeah, that's true more news. She's getting more news coverage than any environmental list on the planet, but it's hard to find her in mainstream news. Is that because it's it's seen as  I read an article I think was in the Atlantic about there was that climate report that came out and was maybe like six months to a year ago. That was just so sobering and it was this kind of art. It was the article was actually about that. It's so sobering that it's almost paralyzing and I think that yeah, I think that with the New Media thing the media wants to give you headlines that make you click right and it's going
9:  Way Beyond their scholarship and the cost of attendance but it's a tough tough issue and if sponsors won't pay big commercial dollars for women's soccer game on TV those women aren't likely to get paid a lot of money for playing soccer before your second trip you met what now is your husband and you got engaged to him in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean while he was back home. Did they engagement inspire you to get home quicker? Yes.  Yes, I asked him if you would marry me he had this romantic response. He said sure why not and from that point on I pretty much wrote around the clock till I get home December 3rd 1999. You completed your journey across the Atlantic at what point? Did you realize this trip was going to be a success? Yeah, probably December first when I saw Guadalupe for the first time in the middle of the ocean because at any point before that, you can always make a mistake that ends it or ends you
 
Topic 3 black hole image: In May 2019 astronomers released the first-ever picture of a black hole.  I would like to hear some conversations and educational discussion about the science of astronomy, black holes, and of the picture itself.
0:  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.
1:  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.  home, I guess I thought then Interstellar Dome into
2:  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if  You fall into a black hole. But how do you even know how that even come along? Do you where does it go? Okay.
3:  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.  Here's how they proved that looks like scientists have actually proved that it's realistic fiction. Jake crazy, like accurate nuclear their time clocks meaning. It's just like a stopwatch but down to like a trillionth of a second and like they put one on the floor and they put one like on a hundred foot platform. And the closer you are to Earth. Obviously the gravity's heavier because like when she get higher gravity gets lighter,
4:  Wow, which brings up a crazy point that I thought about so you always hear about how the universe is like infinitely expanding. Yeah, you always hear that like you've written for me like like all the time Interstellar. It's the best space movie. It's not even just this best space movie. It's the best movie ever.  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if
5:  I'm incontinent. Oh, you're so smart.  That's fucking crazy. Yes a black hole as it's a black hole. Okay, I've seen a lot. I like watch a couple of documentaries on like, what about what a black hole is? Yeah, and I like that's so crazy. Like the the densest gravitation like gravitational pull. Did you know that they had to use like I might get the wrong wrong but like it's like 5 million gigabytes. Yeah beta and two bites and so bites to be able to capture it and it's still so blurry like yeah to capture.
6:  Zero impact to what we do each day. Like it doesn't matter weird. I think it's it is without question is horrible philosophically. Bullet philosophical Phyllis are yeah, I don't me wrong. It's an interesting Trend thought but the fact that it will never matter to us. Yes is the answer and if I just move my everyday routine people are getting I'm just saying like if  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.
7:  That's fucking crazy. Yes a black hole as it's a black hole. Okay, I've seen a lot. I like watch a couple of documentaries on like, what about what a black hole is? Yeah, and I like that's so crazy. Like the the densest gravitation like gravitational pull. Did you know that they had to use like I might get the wrong wrong but like it's like 5 million gigabytes. Yeah beta and two bites and so bites to be able to capture it and it's still so blurry like yeah to capture.  One image. Yeah, that's fucking crazy fucking crazy dude, dude. It's like and I mean women empowerment our because like the girl another girl scientists like it's a female scientist. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, dude it like power to her a man. Fuck we made a ride again.
8: What's up, my self-improvement people? It is Brian Ford with self-improvement daily. Take ownership of your personal development one tip at a time. I wanted to go back and highlight my favorite part of our last self-improvement sit down with Eric Kaufman brilliantly are accused the properties of celestial bodies to segment people into their leadership types in doing so we gained Clarity on the qualities of a conscious leader. Let's hear are Breakdown now, there's three types of celestial elements that I refer to it. Is that the moon the sun and a black hole the most ago like type of leader is a black hole, right? They suck all the energy into them the human being that has the need to just make it all about me and you've met people like that, right? They take the credit and the team they have the best ideas. They have the biggest office. It's all about me me me me me and a black hole is kind of a
9:  we're like, you've got these space pirates that Jared is I think it's really good. It was really cool and even go back to like that point in the story where they're about to ride that Michaela like out of the black hole. You see like a death in the in the film through mr. Arrow. Yeah, like you'd see this tension between mr. And mr. Screw-up who is the spider like looking character in the film early on in the film because they come to sort of like a disagreement of sorts.  And you can see in scripts eyes that like, okay, I'm gonna get you back at some point. Don't worry and mr. Scroop used that point of the whole like the chaotic nature of the Supernova to then be like, oh, this is perfect. This is my perfect moment. Just like exact my revenge. This is during the scene right here with the black hole, right? Yeah, I get sucked in. Yeah. It's a gyms gyms role was to and it kind of sets up for the next scene as well in like when they've after like survive the black hole as well. But Jim's role is to Captain me and says
 
Topic 4 story about riding a bird: I remember hearing a podcast that had a story about a kid riding some kind of bird.  I want to find it again.
0:  First one chickens ducks and turkeys are foul. So what do you think are they foul? The answer is true switch your rushing to the other side of the top of your mouth and brush those molars in the way back to when we say something is foul. We're usually talking about something gross or disgusting like after a smelly.  You might say that burp was foul. Yeah, but foul is also a word we use to talk about birds bowel are a kind of bird that we keep on farms to eat or get eggs from like chickens and ducks and turkeys another word for Birds. We keep for eggs or who is poultry.
1:  My head is perfectly fine. So yeah, pure Jerry and I was there at all the kids were riding around and like I had to walk off the middle of the tracks you go and sit down for a bit and everywhere else is going round and I was the only man bike dirt jumper there as well. So it was like even more perfect Jerry. I like it. Well for me, I've just been doing a bunch of snow riding.  Mmm, well we do this every show is you say well, okay, so I did put on like a rash guard / chain retention thing on the bottom my bottom bracket. I don't think I spaced it out correctly because on the trail I did like a drop-down feature and I backpedaled a little bit which is kind of a No-No if your chains already questionably off of alignment and it got all clogged.
2:  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.  It's the same for the Ducks. I mean, he's divers are flying a foot two feet off the water. And yep. That's a really good point. Yep, you know as far as a lot of people ask me they say I can't believe you would throw a bright white 5 gallon bucket or 25 or 35 gallon barrel into your boat as a decoy. Well a lot of these birds
3:  You might say that burp was foul. Yeah, but foul is also a word we use to talk about birds bowel are a kind of bird that we keep on farms to eat or get eggs from like chickens and ducks and turkeys another word for Birds. We keep for eggs or who is poultry.  Switcher brushing to the bottom of your mouth and give your front teeth the brush to here's your next true or false pigs are extremely dirty animals. So is that true or false is every Pig a dirty Pig. The answer is false. Lots of people think that pigs are a messy animal but pigs are actually pretty tidy pigs got a reputation for being dirty because
4:  Lot of new Hunters those got the careful use the flag to get the birds attention. I had to take Flags away from a lot of my homes and layouts because they wanted to flag the Berks right on past the decoys. So there gets to be a point when he done put the flag down and start shooting at them too. But movement in being seen can really help out a hunter and you'd like I said, you don't necessarily have to have the most expensive decoys on the market.  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.
5: Hello there. My name is Danny Yeoman while bird expert for pets corner and developer of Peter and Paul Byrd Foods. Welcome to the first of a number of podcast detailing some of the amazing birds that we see him feeding our garden each month. We'll be looking at different bird and I thought I'd start off with the nation's favourite bird the wonderful Robin on a misty winter morning. My garden is usually quiet apart that is for the song of one of their communist.  First and most familiar Birds the robin. It's a sound I am used to hearing for unlike virtually every other British bird Robbins held territories and sing more or less all year round.
6:  And you go this is for the visual people and your hand like washes out and then you're doing this and you're still holding onto the bike. That was me. So lost right now. No, I don't think I even had time no, no no front wheel was definitely watch. So as you can see the tape is back and I have sprained another AC joint and I have to take a week off and I've got like bruising all down my side. Luckily. I was wearing my full face helmet  My head is perfectly fine. So yeah, pure Jerry and I was there at all the kids were riding around and like I had to walk off the middle of the tracks you go and sit down for a bit and everywhere else is going round and I was the only man bike dirt jumper there as well. So it was like even more perfect Jerry. I like it. Well for me, I've just been doing a bunch of snow riding.
7:  Pot into the sink or knocking something over whatever it was. It made a clatter. I whipped my head around to look at her in the source of the noise, and it completely spooked her. She had never seen me react to any type of noise or sound before I obviously don't remember any of this as I was a toddler, but I heard the story many times.  My daughter was very hard of hearing due to glue ear when she was 4 she had grommets place to drain the fluid. She woke me up at sunrise the morning after the operation because she could hear the birds outside. It was a Bittersweet moment for me. As I was pleased to see the look of Joy on her face, but greatly saddened that I hadn't realized how bad her hearing had been for her whole life so far. She also come to realize she hates ambulances and Loud motorbikes.
8:  You know what? I'm not gonna tell you just kidding. I saw a bird. So obviously I got up this morning. I looked out my window. I saw a bird that is also not a story as anyone who has ever had a conversation with a four-year-old knows a sequence of actions by itself is not a story four-year-olds. They have the sequence of actions down pretty well, but they lack the next element that you need to make a good story a point a point.  Is element number 2 a good story gets to a point the point can come in many forms. It can be a moment of surprise or Revelation or learning. It can be funny. It can be serious. It can be moving. It just has to be the point to which all the actions are leading and the SlamBall story The Point the place where all the actions relating is this they were blown away and then Runway was like I want this I want this on my
9:  Feels weird to stop there doesn't it? And that is because when human beings listen to a couple of actions in a sequence, we want to know what the next one is. It's almost innate what happened after I looked out my window.  You know what? I'm not gonna tell you just kidding. I saw a bird. So obviously I got up this morning. I looked out my window. I saw a bird that is also not a story as anyone who has ever had a conversation with a four-year-old knows a sequence of actions by itself is not a story four-year-olds. They have the sequence of actions down pretty well, but they lack the next element that you need to make a good story a point a point.
 
Topic 5 daniel ek interview: Someone told me about a podcast interview with Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, about the founding and early days of Spotify.  I would like to find the show and episode that contains that interview.  Other interviews with Ek are relevant as well.
0:  Content I'm going to be pumping out right away in all honesty, but I might do like a reflection episode like when I get there, I don't know yet. I have to figure that out. But I have a few interviews planned out. I do want to try to do some phone interviews to but the interviews I have planned. I'm going to be with those people so that will be really exciting. It'll be nice to get some of my friends on here because  They've been really really supportive of me and I can't thank them enough and having them on the podcast would be so much more fun than just me sitting here talking to you guys, but that concludes today's episode. Don't forget to follow us on Instagram at over-caffeinated pod. And also we are on Apple music or apple podcasts now so you can check us out there if you don't have Spotify then you also don't have to
1: Hey guys, welcome to another episode of the real economy show and this is a very different kind of episode because today it's not interview kind of thing. But right now I'm with a person whom a lot of you know, and with digital fatigue and like this is a super interesting fact this podcast interview took me actually one year  Ear and three months like yeah like more than one year like that's how this person is to get a podcast interview with. So, so anyways right now we are doing this episode because it's my last day with digital pratik like because of some reasons. I will not be continuing with this brand or digital product. So we decided to just shoot this podcast episode and just talk and like I hope you guys
2:  Hello and welcome to start up. I'm Alex blumberg and we are at the third and final episode of startup ever. The last episode of the last season of the very first podcast gimlet ever launched. We're taking you inside the sale of gimlet to the streaming giant Spotify. Just a quick note here at the top. There is some swearing in this episode.  Last episode Matt and I had just come back from a whirlwind trip to Stockholm right before Thanksgiving to meet with Daniel Eck the CEO of spotify and although no one had officially told us this that trip had the feel of a final hurdle before Spotify made an official offer to buy us. And so you might be wondering what's it like to go to Thanksgiving with your entire family your aunts and uncles and cousins in the house where you grew up and your parents still live after just returning from a 22 hour round trip Excursion to Sweden where you may or may not
3:  I forgot I had told you I'm 16. Oh Arthur and love you finding a podcast. I really appreciate the hospitality. Cool. Thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. Right I'll take the key ate it and that's going to be it for the interview. I really appreciate you listening to the major jobs podcast. This one was a really great interview because it was something that was a unique job. It was a CEO but not really a CEO just like a founder of his own business and he was on Shark Tank. So it was really interesting.  To hear about what it was like starting a business and running it, and I'd really like to thank Max for doing this. I really appreciate his insight into what it's like being a founder of a business. And other than that, I really hope you enjoyed this. If you want you can subscribe to this podcast. I'm on Apple Spotify and all the major will podcasting networks. Anyways, thanks for listening, and I'll see you next week. Bye. Bye.
4:  Kind of out there questions. Not that it wasn't cat Platteville irrelevant, but his character relevant and I enjoyed that I enjoyed that they were thinking about that about who would be what character right? I'd love to do it again. So like that was that was really fun. Yeah. I agree. I think the end questions were a really nice way to mix it up from like basically any other interview because you don't really hear that like ever exactly that's gonna wonder why I wanted to do it, you know you  I want to be a little different words, like like going around hyperbole has wonderful question. They have really nice interviews and such like that and it professional but they're always definitely you know, I'm I don't want to take like a cookie cutter anything like that. Now that's kind of rude. But also, um, you know, they're that type of there are different category of interview where it's very professional it has a certain types of questions and it's not really like a I mean, it's up an interview, but it's not an interview for a fan by fans. Not the
5:  But what I wanted to do for this interview was talk to you Daniel because he's helped me a lot and he's given me a lot of advice and I kind of wanted to share that advice with all of you. So if you're a musician yourself, then this is a very very valuable conversation. He is an artist in his own right as I mentioned. He's got a band called local Liars. I will link all all the stuff in the show notes. So check those out but otherwise, let's just get on with the show.  Show here is my interview with Daniel G Harmon. Hi, my name is Mary spender and you are listening to choose Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday Tuesday. I think this is this is how we should start. We should talk about our failures immediately. It could be a weed err day worth of conversation for me. Oh me too. Me too. I'm so open and I love it. I think failing is exactly how you end up somewhere with
6:  To get the interview and it's at the same level as if you're having that interview then yeah the time you heard about it, but then it kind of just Peters out the closer you get to it because you can't maintain that intensity of feeling I guess for that long because I mean physically yeah would be horrible to continually feel like a certain way about it all the way up to when it happens. Yeah, so I it's interesting with me. I have a huge delay, which is so same same example. Yeah job interview. I could try.  I've got a job interview in on Thursday. So like a week. I'm like, I've got a week I am fine every day every day. I'm fine even like the Wednesday. No problem. I think yeah, whatever job interview who cares and obviously my track record with interviews all hideous. I mean I've mentioned before I've never got a job from an interview and in the jobs where I had an interview and got the job is because I knew the person that was interviewing me and it wasn't a real interview but interviews with genuine strangers that have never met before I have never
7:  You also have your own podcast, which I listen to all the time. Um, why don't you talk a little bit about that? So my podcast is called the real real and it's kind of like a play on words because the last real spelled r ee L like a highlight reel a reel of film. So what I thought when I was starting it was I want to start a podcast where I interview people and I didn't only want to interview super successful people. I didn't only want to  Interview like women I didn't only want to interview my friends. Like I wanted to interview a ton of people in different walks of life and I wanted it to be very very real sense the title but very much like not. Oh, how did you become super successful? I wanted it to be like, what are the real struggles of getting to where you are or you might not be where you want to be yet. But what are you doing to get there? Like I interview so many of my friends and different jobs that don't often get highlighted like my
8:  Out there as a brand owner and not be afraid to and you know, you'll hear what she says about that when I get further into this podcast and you guys will hear me say like oh my gosh, like I wish all of my mentees are listening to this because it's really important when she makes that point.

9:  I sewed of over-caffeinated the first one of 2020. I'm so happy you guys have given me a positive feedback and continue listening.

I don't know how much  Content I'm going to be pumping out right away in all honesty, but I might do like a reflection episode like when I get there, I don't know yet. I have to figure that out. But I have a few interviews planned out. I do want to try to do some phone interviews to but the interviews I have planned. I'm going to be with those people so that will be really exciting. It'll be nice to get some of my friends on here because
