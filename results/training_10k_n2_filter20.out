Topic 1 coronavirus spread: What were people saying about the spread of the novel coronavirus NCOV-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019?
0: It started.  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.
1:  Hey, welcome back. So I want to to make today's episode about this continuing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. I think the official name for it is the 2019 novel coronavirus, but many people are referring to it as just the coronavirus the the Wuhan coronavirus Wuhan flew I've seen that go around but and I think a good place to start is just a quick recap. Where were at now of course is subject to change.  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.
2:  Is past whatever the flu kills, you know hundreds of thousands each year. I think they're really important thing to understand about that is that those hundreds of thousands? I mean you have the flu does kill them however the flu as far as we know based on current evidence and whatnot is less contagious or at least I should say has a lower are not number meaning. It's it's not spread as easily.  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%
3:  Alice's of the situation as well as the I guess impact on the economy because of course that's where my mind often times goes. So quick recap. This is a novel virus.  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.
4:  Compared to this novel coronavirus is mortality rate is far far lower less than 1%  And furthermore we've known for a while that the flu even on some of its Worst Years. And of course, I'm excluding certain outbreaks of the flu. There's been like Hong Kong flu many decades ago. There was a Spanish flu or whatever. You want to call it French full American flew back in 1918, excluding those obviously the flu largely targets elderly populations young young populations and immune compromised which based on
5:  Hon, but also some surrounding cities in the cash. I don't remember the name of the province hoobae. He hey some big cities right will haunt itself is roughly 11 million individuals. And this has spread to a ton of other countries around the world including Japan South Korea Thailand Australia. I think there's a potential reported case and France Russia the UK.  I believe and of course the United States we have soon to be three potentially three confirmed cases of this coronavirus here in the United States mostly from people that recently traveled to China usually the Wuhan providence province. And of course, this is a coming up on the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is is a big event for people traveling and whatnot. So certainly not a good time for this virus to be on the move.
6:  Which is related to or in the same family as the the czar's which was the severe severe acute respiratory syndrome, which there's a significant outbreak of in in China and Asia back in like the early 2000s as well as merge which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, very similar virus. They're all coronavirus has this one hasn't been given a name yet. It's just a coronavirus which originated as far as we know at least from the city of Wuhan.  In China and thus far it it, you know, it produces.
7:  Based on his career trajectory. This is not just going to go away anytime soon. Right? I've learned a lot lately and I'm sure many other people have about this this are not of this coronavirus relative to past outbreaks and relative to other infectious diseases. They are not basically is this average number spread out over an entire population and it changes and it's different likely from population to population.  Stand on the point in time and their circumstances Etc.
8:  but get into today's topic, you know, I almost hesitate to throw it another podcast about this this Wuhan this Chinese coronavirus and yet I mean I on this Friday  How can I do anything about that because it really is what is driving the markets today. It's driving a lot of these headlines me. If you turn on the Nightly News, if you turn on most mainstream news programs during the day, if you go over to 0 head, you know, most of the news cycle both financial and non-financial really is is fixated on this this coronavirus. So quick recap on where we're at right now, officially.
9:  And I'll be talking more about these numbers. But but of course this coronavirus it's new to scientists as of 2019 began in the city of Wuhan, which is in the hoobae province of China City of roughly 11 million people and it back in like November December. That's kind of when these cases first started appearing.  And it's a relative of SARS the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was was a big deal back in the early 2000s. Also close relative of Words, which is similar to SARS. But Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome and very similar symptoms and whatnot. And the same is true for Coronavirus. Now that the mortality rate the deadliness of this new coronavirus. It's still up in the air. And again, we'll be talking more about those numbers a little bit later on today's episode.
 
Topic 2 greta thunberg cross atlantic: What were people saying about Greta Thunbergâ€™s sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the fall of 2019 and its relationship to global climate change?
0:  Ooh were fighting climate change is there it exists we have all of the tools in front of us. It's just a matter of acting like this. That's a great idea but like make it so that every new building that's built is NetZero. Like that would be amazing. Another thing that done. I don't know. It's a strange still giant, you know that and subdivision. I'll tell you why it isn't done and this relates to some of the questions you sent me. What what we can do is in relates back to Extinction rebellion, and Greta is  People have to speak up and not just to friends and family and stuff like that. They have to speak out and speak up and show up. Just imagine next Friday right have the second part of the global climate strike on this. Yes on the 27th of Millennium Park 12 to 3, but matching of thousands of people showed up for that rather than I mean probably a few hundred will come and hoping in the Thousand. Yeah, let's get a thousand but I'm saying imagine if that
1:  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.  Because with warm water in the atmosphere is damper, that's all drawn up so that you not only get greater wind speeds. But lot more water is poured down on communities when it comes down and it would have been the past. I'm not sure where the original question was here. But I don't know either keep going. Well Greta to finger good. She's saying that that we need to panic about it because the situation is that bad and even if say we were wrong
2:  Tidwell considered himself a historian first and to salvage your second he couldn't pass up on the opportunity to discover something new. However, he did not have the financial backing to salvage. What was inside the eye 52 descending to 12,000 feet below the surface of the ocean isn't your average cruise for starters the human body cannot survive those depths without the protection of a submarine or other kind of pressurized submersible vehicle. Even the most skilled scoob.  A divers can only reach depths of a thousand feet a salvage operation on this scale need a deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear making multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean that sort of operation would take weeks and cost millions of dollars. And that's when Jim Philip own comes into the story.
3:  A divers can only reach depths of a thousand feet a salvage operation on this scale need a deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear making multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean that sort of operation would take weeks and cost millions of dollars. And that's when Jim Philip own comes into the story.  Jim Phillip own was a wealthy lawyer from Rochester New York Tidwell promised Philip own a cut of the treasure and was able to convince him to invest two million dollars in the mission Philip own also spoke to National Geographic stating quote my motivation for doing it was first and foremost for the excitement and history but profit was by no means a small part of this if Paul is right. There's 20 million dollars worth of gold in the ocean and I
4:  Those right? It's like a regular thing now well water levels are rising around the world because of climate change has occurred just till now and the the speed of it is also a very concerning because I think scientists were saying we wouldn't see a ice-free Arctic North Pole for another 20 or 30 years. I think it's if I have I may be wrong about that but not for 10 or 15 years at least and some  say it could happen this year right for the first time. I know it is the speed at which things are happening is very terrifying because that has dramatic effects. Apparently it'll mess with the currents in the Atlantic Ocean. What's that called the golfing outside of right the Gulf Stream? Okay. Yeah as it slows down the water heats up more and so you get things like not necessarily more hurricanes, but more intense hurricanes.
5:  gravesite and the flag was symbolic of that Phillip Owen on the other hand believe Tidwell was wasting his time and they should focus on finding the gold on November 29th. Philip own fed up with tidwell's Antics took full control of the operation the coup didn't help the mission find success the 1998 Salvage concluded no gold had been discovered. That's not to say there isn't gold inside the eye 52 as  Earlier gold can survive underwater without corrosion. It's possible. It's still inside the submarine a salvage operation that big requires deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear these Subs would likely need to make multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. This sort of operation would take months to complete the 1998 Salvage operation lasted a few weeks and cost Philip own 2 million dollars.
6:  Earlier gold can survive underwater without corrosion. It's possible. It's still inside the submarine a salvage operation that big requires deep sea submarines with saws and other Salvage gear these Subs would likely need to make multiple trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. This sort of operation would take months to complete the 1998 Salvage operation lasted a few weeks and cost Philip own 2 million dollars.  To saw out two tons of gold Parts at a time. It could cost almost 20 million dollars that's around the value of the gold meaning that even if you could get inside the sub and find the gold you wouldn't profit from it the entire operation cost Tidwell and his business partners millions of dollars. The 1998 Salvage operation was not without some Merit the to deep submergence Vehicles were able to photograph and video detailed pictures of the wreckage.
7:  Disaster on a massive scale even more frightening is the possibility of misuse of biotechnology in creating dangerous and resilient diseases pests and weeds. This could be done deliberately as a means of bioterrorism or accidentally by some overzealous. Idiot in a lab coat if disaster movies have taught us anything number three Gulf Stream shut down. The Gulf Stream is a huge global current which carries warm water Northwest across the Atlantic Ocean warming Western and Northern Europe. However, global  Warming is causing problems for this by Heating and melting ice caps into the Gulf Stream Global Warming. Ironically slows it down and there is evidence that if the trend continues it could eventually totally stop as well as making Europe even colder and greater than it already is this could result in disasters ranging from huge climate changes including massive storms to a mass phytoplankton Extinction. You may recognize phytoplankton as the things which everything else eats did I mention that Europe was cold enough already number two.
8:  Way Beyond their scholarship and the cost of attendance but it's a tough tough issue and if sponsors won't pay big commercial dollars for women's soccer game on TV those women aren't likely to get paid a lot of money for playing soccer before your second trip you met what now is your husband and you got engaged to him in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean while he was back home. Did they engagement inspire you to get home quicker? Yes.  Yes, I asked him if you would marry me he had this romantic response. He said sure why not and from that point on I pretty much wrote around the clock till I get home December 3rd 1999. You completed your journey across the Atlantic at what point? Did you realize this trip was going to be a success? Yeah, probably December first when I saw Guadalupe for the first time in the middle of the ocean because at any point before that, you can always make a mistake that ends it or ends you
9:  So they were cutting class to go and stand in front of city hall or the capital and they're still doing it and that's what Greta started a year ago. And now she's up for a Nobel Peace Prize on mainstream news. It's hard to find Greta. Yeah, that's true more news. She's getting more news coverage than any environmental list on the planet, but it's hard to find her in mainstream news. Is that because it's it's seen as  I read an article I think was in the Atlantic about there was that climate report that came out and was maybe like six months to a year ago. That was just so sobering and it was this kind of art. It was the article was actually about that. It's so sobering that it's almost paralyzing and I think that yeah, I think that with the New Media thing the media wants to give you headlines that make you click right and it's going
 
Topic 3 black hole image: In May 2019 astronomers released the first-ever picture of a black hole.  I would like to hear some conversations and educational discussion about the science of astronomy, black holes, and of the picture itself.
0:  Concept of like time and how it's not like time is relative which sounds really weird for us because we're always used to time being the exact same but it's like they go to this planet. It's getting sucked into a black hole in our on that planet is 70 years on Earth and what happens is part of their ship breaks as there's a big wave and it takes a couple hours to get out next thing, you know, they're like 20 years behind 30 years behind and he gets out and his daughters older than him and that is actually scientifically compatible that  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.
1:  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.  home, I guess I thought then Interstellar Dome into
2:  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if  You fall into a black hole. But how do you even know how that even come along? Do you where does it go? Okay.
3:  and Einstein proved that theory and it's because when you're closer to a black hole like the planet is so much heavier in density where so whereas the black hole and I think the fact like there are some but they're so far away because like if you think about it, so how did you test that? How did he figure out that if you're closer to a black hole time? Buckle up boys.  Here's how they proved that looks like scientists have actually proved that it's realistic fiction. Jake crazy, like accurate nuclear their time clocks meaning. It's just like a stopwatch but down to like a trillionth of a second and like they put one on the floor and they put one like on a hundred foot platform. And the closer you are to Earth. Obviously the gravity's heavier because like when she get higher gravity gets lighter,
4:  Wow, which brings up a crazy point that I thought about so you always hear about how the universe is like infinitely expanding. Yeah, you always hear that like you've written for me like like all the time Interstellar. It's the best space movie. It's not even just this best space movie. It's the best movie ever.  - what if we're in a black hole? I hate I hate the what ifs of space what a weird black hole. I don't care. What does it matter? Okay, cool. You can go on and on about what if
5:  I'm incontinent. Oh, you're so smart.  That's fucking crazy. Yes a black hole as it's a black hole. Okay, I've seen a lot. I like watch a couple of documentaries on like, what about what a black hole is? Yeah, and I like that's so crazy. Like the the densest gravitation like gravitational pull. Did you know that they had to use like I might get the wrong wrong but like it's like 5 million gigabytes. Yeah beta and two bites and so bites to be able to capture it and it's still so blurry like yeah to capture.
6:  Zero impact to what we do each day. Like it doesn't matter weird. I think it's it is without question is horrible philosophically. Bullet philosophical Phyllis are yeah, I don't me wrong. It's an interesting Trend thought but the fact that it will never matter to us. Yes is the answer and if I just move my everyday routine people are getting I'm just saying like if  like T said if what happens if you fall into a black hole how many of us are going to fall into a black hole will never know what happens because if somebody does fall in a black hole they will die and you won't know the answer.
7:  In the black hole was like that's like don't the densest it gets right. Am I there's no coming back from that point. Once you're past that point like there's no honey that like absolutely you can't go and you just like you just fall into Old Floyd. Yeah. I get just an endless. Yeah, like like for a human like you would be there and I'm like because there's no light. Like there's like little like the light reflects all over the place. You would just see everything everywhere. Yeah.  Just non non stopping you just like like River Park. Yeah, do you just didn't disintegrate? This Socrates is creating. It's crazy that those things exist. Yeah, like we coexist with these what it's like out here. I have the black holes like nah.
8:  Just non non stopping you just like like River Park. Yeah, do you just didn't disintegrate? This Socrates is creating. It's crazy that those things exist. Yeah, like we coexist with these what it's like out here. I have the black holes like nah.  We really out here.
9: What's up, my self-improvement people? It is Brian Ford with self-improvement daily. Take ownership of your personal development one tip at a time. I wanted to go back and highlight my favorite part of our last self-improvement sit down with Eric Kaufman brilliantly are accused the properties of celestial bodies to segment people into their leadership types in doing so we gained Clarity on the qualities of a conscious leader. Let's hear are Breakdown now, there's three types of celestial elements that I refer to it. Is that the moon the sun and a black hole the most ago like type of leader is a black hole, right? They suck all the energy into them the human being that has the need to just make it all about me and you've met people like that, right? They take the credit and the team they have the best ideas. They have the biggest office. It's all about me me me me me and a black hole is kind of a
 
Topic 4 story about riding a bird: I remember hearing a podcast that had a story about a kid riding some kind of bird.  I want to find it again.
0:  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.  It's the same for the Ducks. I mean, he's divers are flying a foot two feet off the water. And yep. That's a really good point. Yep, you know as far as a lot of people ask me they say I can't believe you would throw a bright white 5 gallon bucket or 25 or 35 gallon barrel into your boat as a decoy. Well a lot of these birds
1:  Pot into the sink or knocking something over whatever it was. It made a clatter. I whipped my head around to look at her in the source of the noise, and it completely spooked her. She had never seen me react to any type of noise or sound before I obviously don't remember any of this as I was a toddler, but I heard the story many times.  My daughter was very hard of hearing due to glue ear when she was 4 she had grommets place to drain the fluid. She woke me up at sunrise the morning after the operation because she could hear the birds outside. It was a Bittersweet moment for me. As I was pleased to see the look of Joy on her face, but greatly saddened that I hadn't realized how bad her hearing had been for her whole life so far. She also come to realize she hates ambulances and Loud motorbikes.
2:  Lot of new Hunters those got the careful use the flag to get the birds attention. I had to take Flags away from a lot of my homes and layouts because they wanted to flag the Berks right on past the decoys. So there gets to be a point when he done put the flag down and start shooting at them too. But movement in being seen can really help out a hunter and you'd like I said, you don't necessarily have to have the most expensive decoys on the market.  A few to finish the birds get a few down the land but didn't seen as a whole other story so little bit there to scratch the surface for guys to think about ya think the the over visibility on big water and if you're driving or riding your boat or whatever you call it. I don't know driving Captain. Anyways, you're going You're Going Through the water. And if you have any sort of chop, you're not going to see those Ducks until until you kick them up and anything going.
3: Hello there. My name is Danny Yeoman while bird expert for pets corner and developer of Peter and Paul Byrd Foods. Welcome to the first of a number of podcast detailing some of the amazing birds that we see him feeding our garden each month. We'll be looking at different bird and I thought I'd start off with the nation's favourite bird the wonderful Robin on a misty winter morning. My garden is usually quiet apart that is for the song of one of their communist.  First and most familiar Birds the robin. It's a sound I am used to hearing for unlike virtually every other British bird Robbins held territories and sing more or less all year round.
4:  My head is perfectly fine. So yeah, pure Jerry and I was there at all the kids were riding around and like I had to walk off the middle of the tracks you go and sit down for a bit and everywhere else is going round and I was the only man bike dirt jumper there as well. So it was like even more perfect Jerry. I like it. Well for me, I've just been doing a bunch of snow riding.  Mmm, well we do this every show is you say well, okay, so I did put on like a rash guard / chain retention thing on the bottom my bottom bracket. I don't think I spaced it out correctly because on the trail I did like a drop-down feature and I backpedaled a little bit which is kind of a No-No if your chains already questionably off of alignment and it got all clogged.
5:  And you go this is for the visual people and your hand like washes out and then you're doing this and you're still holding onto the bike. That was me. So lost right now. No, I don't think I even had time no, no no front wheel was definitely watch. So as you can see the tape is back and I have sprained another AC joint and I have to take a week off and I've got like bruising all down my side. Luckily. I was wearing my full face helmet  My head is perfectly fine. So yeah, pure Jerry and I was there at all the kids were riding around and like I had to walk off the middle of the tracks you go and sit down for a bit and everywhere else is going round and I was the only man bike dirt jumper there as well. So it was like even more perfect Jerry. I like it. Well for me, I've just been doing a bunch of snow riding.
6:  but the way that makes me feel better, I guess in a sense is that  That's their I don't want to say that's their problem. But I mean it is kind of like their gross in that they're doing that. They're being that disgusting. Yeah, but they're going to do that whether we're at the beach weather even even there's people that want to do that the mall they're going to be watching your Ki they are I mean you sure papers out there all over the place. That's what I was going to say their stories all the time about. Oh this pedophile. Yeah in the bathrooms or like you said at the pool, you know, that's been a big one. I mean I've even heard stories of kids in
7:  Loud and be heard and some kids have something really intense that to get that out and to have a population really respect. What they have to say is Meaningful on a on a deeper level. So, you know, we have had a girl talk about her brother's struggle with cancer and we've had kids talk about race. So we've really run the gamut between really serious topics and lighter and sometimes these kids literally.  A just like improv it out and maybe just create a list of things that help him remember and some kids sit down and write the whole story and some kids speak to type. So we take them. So if they have struggles with writing we don't want it to feel like school because school you get a grade you don't get a grade with this and that's what I was curious if there's any type of feedback and it sounds like it's just like whatever you want to say.
8:  My daughter was very hard of hearing due to glue ear when she was 4 she had grommets place to drain the fluid. She woke me up at sunrise the morning after the operation because she could hear the birds outside. It was a Bittersweet moment for me. As I was pleased to see the look of Joy on her face, but greatly saddened that I hadn't realized how bad her hearing had been for her whole life so far. She also come to realize she hates ambulances and Loud motorbikes.  Oh, I have a great story friend's sister was very hard of hearing nearly deaf. She got Cochlear implants at work. I was asked to help her pair her implants with her new phone because they're freaking Bluetooth while I'm doing this. She is happily telling me how sensitive they are. I can hear paper. She had no idea paper sliding on paper made a noise. She then told me she could hear her hand sliding on the wall, and how cats annoyed her.
9:  First and most familiar Birds the robin. It's a sound I am used to hearing for unlike virtually every other British bird Robbins held territories and sing more or less all year round.  That's not the only surprising thing about the robin common and familiar this little bird. Maybe it still has the capacity to surprise us. They are proof then one birds for you at least Britain's gardeners are pigs centuries ago. When wild boar freely roam the nation's Countryside. It's frequent companion was the little Robin
 
Topic 5 daniel ek interview: Someone told me about a podcast interview with Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, about the founding and early days of Spotify.  I would like to find the show and episode that contains that interview.  Other interviews with Ek are relevant as well.
0:  Hello and welcome to start up. I'm Alex blumberg and we are at the third and final episode of startup ever. The last episode of the last season of the very first podcast gimlet ever launched. We're taking you inside the sale of gimlet to the streaming giant Spotify. Just a quick note here at the top. There is some swearing in this episode.  Last episode Matt and I had just come back from a whirlwind trip to Stockholm right before Thanksgiving to meet with Daniel Eck the CEO of spotify and although no one had officially told us this that trip had the feel of a final hurdle before Spotify made an official offer to buy us. And so you might be wondering what's it like to go to Thanksgiving with your entire family your aunts and uncles and cousins in the house where you grew up and your parents still live after just returning from a 22 hour round trip Excursion to Sweden where you may or may not
1:  Easy, I would laughingly go into any case interview and I know I could rock roll in there.  But it's not because I know so many Frameworks or I know so much about business or I know so much about any industry. It's because I've understood what's happening. They're actually the case interview. It's great. It's fun. Okay get into the mindset that this is going to be a fun conversation. I coached one guy. He got an offer from McKinsey later on and he did the case interview and the interview afterwards said, you know what I have
2:  His Connection in Birmingham. There's this like this Melting Pot of cultures and like and and different countries and different people of different nationalities coming together. And so for him, that's how that was his connection to reggae music then I found out that there's going to be a biopic about him and he's like, wow, this is did you interview the interview. I told him I heard there's a biopic being written about you and oh he didn't know that know if you let me finish.  It's my sentence. I promise you won't tell you the story. So basically during the interview I found out that weed through my research that there was a biopic being written about him. So it's like hey, I heard there's a biopic about you and he's like, how do you know it's not been written yet. So they're commissioning it. Obviously they'll they'll contact you when they want to write that one could do something about your life and then I asked him like who would you cast as like who'd played the young Apache Indian and like was kind of fun?
3:  But it's not because I know so many Frameworks or I know so much about business or I know so much about any industry. It's because I've understood what's happening. They're actually the case interview. It's great. It's fun. Okay get into the mindset that this is going to be a fun conversation. I coached one guy. He got an offer from McKinsey later on and he did the case interview and the interview afterwards said, you know what I have  Laugh that much and that hard during an interview before and it was just a fun thing you do together. It's a dance and I'm telling you all these things about the dance and laughing to get your mindset straight check out first before we get into this whole topic check out what think about the case interview. Check out what your mind is telling you about this.
4:  I'm with Apache and image I mentioned before I was like, oh my 90's childhood coming alive. And when I interviewed him one of the things that was super fun was that I found out his connection to reggae and Jamaica, which was that he had a Jamaican Nanny as a kid and he grew up speaking Patois and so he understood it and understood the music which is where his connection like, why would that's Punjabi guy do reggae music? Okay, that was  His Connection in Birmingham. There's this like this Melting Pot of cultures and like and and different countries and different people of different nationalities coming together. And so for him, that's how that was his connection to reggae music then I found out that there's going to be a biopic about him and he's like, wow, this is did you interview the interview. I told him I heard there's a biopic being written about you and oh he didn't know that know if you let me finish.
5:  Listen to the podcast episodes on writing your CV and there's also videos in the group where we are path already done a couple of reviews watch those invest a few hours and learning.

7:  The case interview will spend the next episodes talking about the case interview the ins and outs and how to do this as usual. You know, 80% of success is psychology is mindset and that the same goes for the case interview most are scared of the case interview or it's it's got a this is reputation that it's higher than only the best can do it.  So let's first get into a mindset where you understand that the case interview is super easy. You have to see from my perspective today. I'll I I would love to do case interviews. This would be super easy, but it's not because I have all this experience or because I'm smart or anything but because I have so well understood what this whole thing is about that it became

Do you see the whole thing of the day with the jealous that like turnips the Vogue interview with Rihanna with like no questions. I thought that was it was I mean, it was like one of those things I think the day what bit taken out of context / like don't know she tries to be funny about it. But basically this journalist who is doing the interview with Rihanna for u.s. Vote. The whole opener of the interview is how like Rihanna had changed the timing and the date of the interview, so she  I was pulled to do it really swiftly had to like zoom over in her car wasn't prepared at all. So tied up change the time they're not the day. Yeah, I really should have ties are a total nerd is she like wasn't prepped was like, oh you have to help me. She like makes a big thing of it in the piece being right at wasn't perhaps and everyone was like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, why would you actually know if anyone can like change things around? It's Rihanna. Wow, I didn't see the backlash. Maybe I'm not on the journey. But yeah and then it became very like do you turn after an interview with questions or do you just like go with it? But well, I think

How did you pay your rent like that kind of stuff? I had like one of the worst mood in New York stories. I moved here after college first. I'd always wanted to live here.

I thought I was a millionaire. I saw that sounds like a pretty rich moves. Yeah. I was like this hot little thing with like TT Ted some like I'm gonna get a hundred jobs and 4 seconds and
2:  But there are ways to find actual real apartments in real opportunities for housing in these groups. So I wouldn't neglect them at all. So once I found my sublet I kind of just packed up my clothes put them on the train and unpacked when I got to New York and then I slowly moved all my stuff from there. I wasn't ready to fully commit to Bringing like my furniture and buying a bed and things like that yet because I was waiting to move into my first own rented apartment with my three best.  Friends from college. So I sublet the apartment then all my friends my three best friends moved to New York and we got an apartment together and I would say we were probably settled in our apartment by August now, so that's kind of the logistics of moving to New York. It wasn't super hard. It wasn't super difficult for me because I ordered all new furniture and I really just had to move my clothes from Philly to New York City, but the hard part came in with the emotional part of it for me. It was really

He didn't have time to deal with it. So he needed Anna to come down to the office and take care of it for him. Anna readily complied when she reached the office. However, she didn't find a beleaguered colleague.  Said she found two members of Scott Carmichael's investigative team. She was under arrest like always Anna kept her cool. She claimed her right to remain silent and asked for legal counsel a female officer searched her and then the team led her out of the building in handcuffs. Anna was so quiet that most of her colleagues didn't even look up as she went by
4:  So that is what I will do today. I will simply talk about New York State not even New York City that probably deserves its own podcast, New York City such a big city.  But I will do New York State and have New York City only a small part of this podcast.
5:  Friends from college. So I sublet the apartment then all my friends my three best friends moved to New York and we got an apartment together and I would say we were probably settled in our apartment by August now, so that's kind of the logistics of moving to New York. It wasn't super hard. It wasn't super difficult for me because I ordered all new furniture and I really just had to move my clothes from Philly to New York City, but the hard part came in with the emotional part of it for me. It was really  really hard to wrap my head around not being in college anymore. It was super hard for me to think that like this was going to be my life for the rest of my life waking up every day and going to work and not experiencing new people every single day and having to really put myself out there in order to meet people. It was kind of like a wave of shock like because when you're in college new people and new experiences are constantly thrown at you every single
6:  And we're back talking about the state of New York not New York City the state of New York. The state of New York is the fourth most populous state.  So lot of people live in New York, and of course New York City is the United States biggest city with approximately 8 million people.
7:  Apart given these qualities and her past Behavior. It's not surprising that on a decided to stay. She later said she didn't want to give up on the people. She was helping but chances are she couldn't bear to think they might be. Alright without her.  On September 21st 2001 Anna arrived at her office and started work as usual, but at 10:15 a.m. She got a call from a supervisor saying that there was a problem with one of her subordinates. He didn't have time to deal with it. So he needed Anna to come down to the office and take care of it for him. Anna readily complied when she reached the office. However, she didn't find a beleaguered colleague.
8:  So New York state has so much information that I feel it deserves its own podcast.  So that is what I will do today. I will simply talk about New York State not even New York City that probably deserves its own podcast, New York City such a big city.
9:  At night. Oh, no, but it's I mean, it's like what? I'm sure what I'm getting at is my mom would bring it into work when I think onto my first Broadway show and I was six so like I my parents just I think we didn't want me to be like a small town girl. So I was coming to New York and seeing shows and spending two grand a day trips and overnight trips with my with my family at a young age. I knew I always want to live here, you know, you seen all the movies, you know, you have that dream of like I'm going to work in advertising in New York City, you know, so and I made an odd choice. I went to school at Clemson and the South and then I after graduation was like well do their New York or Atlanta?  I had more friends in Atlanta. I thought New York will be too hard and too difficult and too expensive. So moved to Atlanta and then just over stayed. I stayed there for eleven years and I always knew still New York was the goal. But at that point once I was out of my like early 20s, I was like I need to make enough money to like live alone and live how I'm living in Atlanta somewhat, you know in New York, so I hit that point and like 2015. I had a boyfriend at the time. It was kind of a back-and-forth toxic relationship, but I had
 
Topic 8 facebook stock prediction: After Facebookâ€™s Q4 2018 earnings call, what were expertsâ€™ predictions and expectations for its stock price in 2019?  How did these predictions fare over time?  Relevant material would include predictions immediately following the Jan 29, 2019, earnings call, and later actual stock performance that could be used to evaluate predictions.
0:  Does of course and how does that impact the stock to flow model and maybe your prediction so I did the analysis I implemented for different ways of adjusting for lost coins. The original way was to just ignore the first million coins so-called Satoshi coins. We don't know of course if those were still she coins, but that's that's the narrative and well those coins haven't moved. So so let's let's  do as if they are lost. So that's one approach then I did the no adjustment approach. So in leave those 1 million in there, I did a gradual loss scenario. So we're sort of about 4 million lost coins rattle around around now 2019. So that's about what is it 30-something percent.
1:  Great to get feedback and especially from guys like like juror who are in the space for almost from the beginning. So and that's also why I put everything on Twitter and GitHub to get the feedback to learn. So yeah, I appreciate his for concerns very much and let's go through them. Yeah the Lost coins. That is a question. That's asked more. How does that impact the the stock?  Does of course and how does that impact the stock to flow model and maybe your prediction so I did the analysis I implemented for different ways of adjusting for lost coins. The original way was to just ignore the first million coins so-called Satoshi coins. We don't know of course if those were still she coins, but that's that's the narrative and well those coins haven't moved. So so let's let's
2:  One of the quotes are I guess two of the quotes that I had highlighted here and I'm looking at chapter 7 a reactive Trader is looking for confirmation and a predictive Trader is just guessing and then the next paragraph over Steve says the bottom line is that if you want to be a successful Trader, there must be a reason for everything you do based on price action and charts and really that's all you need to know don't just willy-nilly buy stocks. Don't just sell options. Don't just buy options. You have to have an actual.  Or reason as to why and then a reason as to why you're going to get out. Hey, this is a very controversial podcast. You're going to have Curtis. I can't wait process Quantified not I mean that's they never get past the predictions or the opinions are the that's the biggest problem of predicting is the future doesn't exist. And to think that you can figure out what every single person every single Trader an investor in every news source and every politician and and the Federal Reserve and other country. I mean II think that you can you know,
3:  Another piece of news from last week was Apples announcement of its Q2 results on Tuesday overall earnings beat expectations, but iPhone sales disappointed 2q earnings per share came in at two dollars and 18 cents, which was down 7% year-over-year, but did actually Beat the Street expectation of two dollars and ten cents per share by eight cents strong services and wearables revenue help drive to cue out performance against a declining iPhone Revenue.  New iPhone sales make up less than half of Apple cells. And this is the first time that is come to down to this level since 2012.
4:  And that they will continue easy monetary policies, which the stock market likes. So the stock market after that kind of exploded upward and then Apple earnings yesterday exceeded expectations on price, even though the top and bottom line results were both below expectations. So you never can tell how the earnings report will impact the stock price. So anyway, so today we're talking about Facebook now Facebook. Well, I was looking at my phone. So this where I was  That I was looking at my phone. That's why I saw at the NASDAQ was up again. And I was like that's strange why is it up again? And then I saw that Facebook had their earnings and they have well exceeded their expectations for earnings. Now Facebook's earnings are pretty interesting just a couple of quarters ago Facebook Drop Like 25% after earnings. It was a huge huge massive Cliff that they jumped off of today. They're trying to do the opposite. It is up Seventeen dollars in
5:  Hey there, Tim and Traders and welcome back to the how to trade stocks and options podcast where we give you the tools tips and tricks to help you trade faster and trade smarter. I'm your host Chris for you'll photo on the top 100 people in finance for 2019. And today we're going to be focusing on Facebook earnings now Facebook. Actually, I was looking at my phone this morning and I saw at the NASDAQ was up again after two trail yesterday with apple and the fed the FED essentially saying that they are going to be holding rates steady.  And that they will continue easy monetary policies, which the stock market likes. So the stock market after that kind of exploded upward and then Apple earnings yesterday exceeded expectations on price, even though the top and bottom line results were both below expectations. So you never can tell how the earnings report will impact the stock price. So anyway, so today we're talking about Facebook now Facebook. Well, I was looking at my phone. So this where I was
6:  Or reason as to why and then a reason as to why you're going to get out. Hey, this is a very controversial podcast. You're going to have Curtis. I can't wait process Quantified not I mean that's they never get past the predictions or the opinions are the that's the biggest problem of predicting is the future doesn't exist. And to think that you can figure out what every single person every single Trader an investor in every news source and every politician and and the Federal Reserve and other country. I mean II think that you can you know,  Know what's gonna happen? The future is absolutely absurd because if you did, you know, you would already be completely be a psychic and a billionaire. If you did, you know, that was there you go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're telling me that everybody I love doing that. All right people I work with think I'm the absolute worst because like I do this this is this is not political base. This is not a political podcast. But one of my favorite things to do in life is troll people like in real life. I don't do it online. And so somebody will say did you know Trump did this?
7:  Now, let's take a look at the news from last week. The biggest news was definitely the federal reserve's two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday that resulted in them cut in the FED funds rate by a quarter percentage point. This is the first time that the FED is cut interest rates since 2008. So definitely a big deal and the FED is attempting to cushion the US economy from a global slowdown and the continuing tensions from trade talks with China as well as lower than expected inflation.  Another piece of news from last week was Apples announcement of its Q2 results on Tuesday overall earnings beat expectations, but iPhone sales disappointed 2q earnings per share came in at two dollars and 18 cents, which was down 7% year-over-year, but did actually Beat the Street expectation of two dollars and ten cents per share by eight cents strong services and wearables revenue help drive to cue out performance against a declining iPhone Revenue.
8:  That I was looking at my phone. That's why I saw at the NASDAQ was up again. And I was like that's strange why is it up again? And then I saw that Facebook had their earnings and they have well exceeded their expectations for earnings. Now Facebook's earnings are pretty interesting just a couple of quarters ago Facebook Drop Like 25% after earnings. It was a huge huge massive Cliff that they jumped off of today. They're trying to do the opposite. It is up Seventeen dollars in  market trading from the prior close of a hundred fifty is currently trading at 167 which is an 11% move up. That's really strong. And that's actually what I wanted to show you today is how you can calculate your own expected move on any stock in any time frame to get an idea of what could be what could be priced into things. So the first thing that we do is we go into the Facebook options chain, and we'd have to go to the strike from
9:  I have three cars that they're selling that is the model 3 Model S and model X background a little bit of History. They were founded in 2003 by a group of Engineers, which did not include Elon Musk. They're called Tesla Motors during the series a funding. Tesla was joined by Elon Musk. So contrary to popular belief Elon Musk is not the founder. Although he is now the face the CEO the Twitter presence. He's basically 99% of Tesla. That's his like you think you are. Yeah. I mean, he owns a ton of stock to  ooh, so it's really him. He's riding down with this and he is true to form. He is controversial as they come. Yes. All right, before we talk about their earnings and some of their future growth stuff will talk about the valuation just so you get a base. They have a market cap of forty four point nine three billion dollars. They have a ticker symbol of TSLA and a stock price of two hundred fifty eight dollars and sixty six cents. They have no price to earnings as of now since they've only been profitable for well this quarter they weren't problem of the
